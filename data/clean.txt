adventure scandal in bohemia



to sherlock holmes she is always the woman have seldom heard
him mention her under any other name in his eyes she eclipses
and predominates the whole of her sex it was not that he felt
any emotion akin to love for irene adler all emotions and that
one particularly were abhorrent to his cold precise but
admirably balanced mind he was take it the most perfect
reasoning and observing machine that the world has seen but as
lover he would have placed himself in false position he never
spoke of the softer passions save with gibe and sneer they
were admirable things for the observerexcellent for drawing the
veil from mens motives and actions but for the trained reasoner
to admit such intrusions into his own delicate and finely
adjusted temperament was to introduce distracting factor which
might throw doubt upon all his mental results grit in
sensitive instrument or crack in one of his own highpower
lenses would not be more disturbing than strong emotion in
nature such as his and yet there was but one woman to him and
that woman was the late irene adler of dubious and questionable
memory

had seen little of holmes lately my marriage had drifted us
away from each other my own complete happiness and the
homecentred interests which rise up around the man who first
finds himself master of his own establishment were sufficient to
absorb all my attention while holmes who loathed every form of
society with his whole bohemian soul remained in our lodgings in
baker street buried among his old books and alternating from
week to week between cocaine and ambition the drowsiness of the
drug and the fierce energy of his own keen nature he was still
as ever deeply attracted by the study of crime and occupied his
immense faculties and extraordinary powers of observation in
following out those clues and clearing up those mysteries which
had been abandoned as hopeless by the official police from time
to time heard some vague account of his doings of his summons
to odessa in the case of the trepoff murder of his clearing up
of the singular tragedy of the atkinson brothers at trincomalee
and finally of the mission which he had accomplished so
delicately and successfully for the reigning family of holland
beyond these signs of his activity however which merely
shared with all the readers of the daily press knew little of
my former friend and companion

one nightit was on the twentieth of march was
returning from journey to patient for had now returned to
civil practice when my way led me through baker street as
passed the wellremembered door which must always be associated
in my mind with my wooing and with the dark incidents of the
study in scarlet was seized with keen desire to see holmes
again and to know how he was employing his extraordinary powers
his rooms were brilliantly lit and even as looked up saw
his tall spare figure pass twice in dark silhouette against
the blind he was pacing the room swiftly eagerly with his head
sunk upon his chest and his hands clasped behind him to me who
knew his every mood and habit his attitude and manner told their
own story he was at work again he had risen out of his
drugcreated dreams and was hot upon the scent of some new
problem rang the bell and was shown up to the chamber which
had formerly been in part my own

his manner was not effusive it seldom was but he was glad
think to see me with hardly word spoken but with kindly
eye he waved me to an armchair threw across his case of cigars
and indicated spirit case and gasogene in the corner then he
stood before the fire and looked me over in his singular
introspective fashion

wedlock suits you he remarked think watson that you have
put on seven and half pounds since saw you

seven answered

indeed should have thought little more just trifle more
fancy watson and in practice again observe you did not
tell me that you intended to go into harness

then how do you know

see it deduce it how do know that you have been getting
yourself very wet lately and that you have most clumsy and
careless servant girl

my dear holmes said this is too much you would certainly
have been burned had you lived few centuries ago it is true
that had country walk on thursday and came home in dreadful
mess but as have changed my clothes cant imagine how you
deduce it as to mary jane she is incorrigible and my wife has
given her notice but there again fail to see how you work it
out

he chuckled to himself and rubbed his long nervous hands
together

it is simplicity itself said he my eyes tell me that on the
inside of your left shoe just where the firelight strikes it
the leather is scored by six almost parallel cuts obviously they
have been caused by someone who has very carelessly scraped round
the edges of the sole in order to remove crusted mud from it
hence you see my double deduction that you had been out in vile
weather and that you had particularly malignant bootslitting
specimen of the london slavey as to your practice if
gentleman walks into my rooms smelling of iodoform with black
mark of nitrate of silver upon his right forefinger and bulge
on the right side of his tophat to show where he has secreted
his stethoscope must be dull indeed if do not pronounce
him to be an active member of the medical profession

could not help laughing at the ease with which he explained his
process of deduction when hear you give your reasons
remarked the thing always appears to me to be so ridiculously
simple that could easily do it myself though at each
successive instance of your reasoning am baffled until you
explain your process and yet believe that my eyes are as good
as yours

quite so he answered lighting cigarette and throwing
himself down into an armchair you see but you do not observe
the distinction is clear for example you have frequently seen
the steps which lead up from the hall to this room

frequently

how often

well some hundreds of times

then how many are there

how many dont know

quite so you have not observed and yet you have seen that is
just my point now know that there are seventeen steps
because have both seen and observed bytheway since you are
interested in these little problems and since you are good
enough to chronicle one or two of my trifling experiences you
may be interested in this he threw over sheet of thick
pinktinted notepaper which had been lying open upon the table
it came by the last post said he read it aloud

the note was undated and without either signature or address

there will call upon you tonight at quarter to eight
oclock it said gentleman who desires to consult you upon
matter of the very deepest moment your recent services to one of
the royal houses of europe have shown that you are one who may
safely be trusted with matters which are of an importance which
can hardly be exaggerated this account of you we have from all
quarters received be in your chamber then at that hour and do
not take it amiss if your visitor wear mask

this is indeed mystery remarked what do you imagine that
it means

have no data yet it is capital mistake to theorize before
one has data insensibly one begins to twist facts to suit
theories instead of theories to suit facts but the note itself
what do you deduce from it

carefully examined the writing and the paper upon which it was
written

the man who wrote it was presumably well to do remarked
endeavouring to imitate my companions processes such paper
could not be bought under half crown packet it is peculiarly
strong and stiff

peculiarthat is the very word said holmes it is not an
english paper at all hold it up to the light

did so and saw large with small and
large with small woven into the texture of the paper

what do you make of that asked holmes

the name of the maker no doubt or his monogram rather

not at all the with the small stands for
gesellschaft which is the german for company it is
customary contraction like our co of course stands for
papier now for the eg let us glance at our continental
gazetteer he took down heavy brown volume from his shelves
eglow eglonitzhere we are egria it is in germanspeaking
countryin bohemia not far from carlsbad remarkable as being
the scene of the death of wallenstein and for its numerous
glassfactories and papermills ha ha my boy what do you
make of that his eyes sparkled and he sent up great blue
triumphant cloud from his cigarette

the paper was made in bohemia said

precisely and the man who wrote the note is german do you
note the peculiar construction of the sentencethis account of
you we have from all quarters received frenchman or russian
could not have written that it is the german who is so
uncourteous to his verbs it only remains therefore to discover
what is wanted by this german who writes upon bohemian paper and
prefers wearing mask to showing his face and here he comes if
am not mistaken to resolve all our doubts

as he spoke there was the sharp sound of horses hoofs and
grating wheels against the curb followed by sharp pull at the
bell holmes whistled

pair by the sound said he yes he continued glancing
out of the window nice little brougham and pair of
beauties hundred and fifty guineas apiece theres money in
this case watson if there is nothing else

think that had better go holmes

not bit doctor stay where you are am lost without my
boswell and this promises to be interesting it would be pity
to miss it

but your client

never mind him may want your help and so may he here he
comes sit down in that armchair doctor and give us your best
attention

slow and heavy step which had been heard upon the stairs and
in the passage paused immediately outside the door then there
was loud and authoritative tap

come in said holmes

man entered who could hardly have been less than six feet six
inches in height with the chest and limbs of hercules his
dress was rich with richness which would in england be looked
upon as akin to bad taste heavy bands of astrakhan were slashed
across the sleeves and fronts of his doublebreasted coat while
the deep blue cloak which was thrown over his shoulders was lined
with flamecoloured silk and secured at the neck with brooch
which consisted of single flaming beryl boots which extended
halfway up his calves and which were trimmed at the tops with
rich brown fur completed the impression of barbaric opulence
which was suggested by his whole appearance he carried
broadbrimmed hat in his hand while he wore across the upper
part of his face extending down past the cheekbones black
vizard mask which he had apparently adjusted that very moment
for his hand was still raised to it as he entered from the lower
part of the face he appeared to be man of strong character
with thick hanging lip and long straight chin suggestive
of resolution pushed to the length of obstinacy

you had my note he asked with deep harsh voice and
strongly marked german accent told you that would call he
looked from one to the other of us as if uncertain which to
address

pray take seat said holmes this is my friend and
colleague dr watson who is occasionally good enough to help me
in my cases whom have the honour to address

you may address me as the count von kramm bohemian nobleman
understand that this gentleman your friend is man of honour
and discretion whom may trust with matter of the most
extreme importance if not should much prefer to communicate
with you alone

rose to go but holmes caught me by the wrist and pushed me
back into my chair it is both or none said he you may say
before this gentleman anything which you may say to me

the count shrugged his broad shoulders then must begin said
he by binding you both to absolute secrecy for two years at
the end of that time the matter will be of no importance at
present it is not too much to say that it is of such weight it
may have an influence upon european history

promise said holmes

and

you will excuse this mask continued our strange visitor the
august person who employs me wishes his agent to be unknown to
you and may confess at once that the title by which have
just called myself is not exactly my own

was aware of it said holmes dryly

the circumstances are of great delicacy and every precaution
has to be taken to quench what might grow to be an immense
scandal and seriously compromise one of the reigning families of
europe to speak plainly the matter implicates the great house
of ormstein hereditary kings of bohemia

was also aware of that murmured holmes settling himself
down in his armchair and closing his eyes

our visitor glanced with some apparent surprise at the languid
lounging figure of the man who had been no doubt depicted to him
as the most incisive reasoner and most energetic agent in europe
holmes slowly reopened his eyes and looked impatiently at his
gigantic client

if your majesty would condescend to state your case he
remarked should be better able to advise you

the man sprang from his chair and paced up and down the room in
uncontrollable agitation then with gesture of desperation he
tore the mask from his face and hurled it upon the ground you
are right he cried am the king why should attempt to
conceal it

why indeed murmured holmes your majesty had not spoken
before was aware that was addressing wilhelm gottsreich
sigismond von ormstein grand duke of casselfelstein and
hereditary king of bohemia

but you can understand said our strange visitor sitting down
once more and passing his hand over his high white forehead you
can understand that am not accustomed to doing such business in
my own person yet the matter was so delicate that could not
confide it to an agent without putting myself in his power
have come incognito from prague for the purpose of consulting
you

then pray consult said holmes shutting his eyes once more

the facts are briefly these some five years ago during
lengthy visit to warsaw made the acquaintance of the wellknown
adventuress irene adler the name is no doubt familiar to you

kindly look her up in my index doctor murmured holmes without
opening his eyes for many years he had adopted system of
docketing all paragraphs concerning men and things so that it
was difficult to name subject or person on which he could not
at once furnish information in this case found her biography
sandwiched in between that of hebrew rabbi and that of
staffcommander who had written monograph upon the deepsea
fishes

let me see said holmes hum born in new jersey in the year
contraltohum la scala hum prima donna imperial opera
of warsawyes retired from operatic stageha living in
londonquite so your majesty as understand became entangled
with this young person wrote her some compromising letters and
is now desirous of getting those letters back

precisely so but how

was there secret marriage

none

no legal papers or certificates

none

then fail to follow your majesty if this young person should
produce her letters for blackmailing or other purposes how is
she to prove their authenticity

there is the writing

pooh pooh forgery

my private notepaper

stolen

my own seal

imitated

my photograph

bought

we were both in the photograph

oh dear that is very bad your majesty has indeed committed an
indiscretion

was madinsane

you have compromised yourself seriously

was only crown prince then was young am but thirty now

it must be recovered

we have tried and failed

your majesty must pay it must be bought

she will not sell

stolen then

five attempts have been made twice burglars in my pay ransacked
her house once we diverted her luggage when she travelled twice
she has been waylaid there has been no result

no sign of it

absolutely none

holmes laughed it is quite pretty little problem said he

but very serious one to me returned the king reproachfully

very indeed and what does she propose to do with the
photograph

to ruin me

but how

am about to be married

so have heard

to clotilde lothman von saxemeningen second daughter of the
king of scandinavia you may know the strict principles of her
family she is herself the very soul of delicacy shadow of
doubt as to my conduct would bring the matter to an end

and irene adler

threatens to send them the photograph and she will do it
know that she will do it you do not know her but she has soul
of steel she has the face of the most beautiful of women and
the mind of the most resolute of men rather than should marry
another woman there are no lengths to which she would not
gonone

you are sure that she has not sent it yet

am sure

and why

because she has said that she would send it on the day when the
betrothal was publicly proclaimed that will be next monday

oh then we have three days yet said holmes with yawn that
is very fortunate as have one or two matters of importance to
look into just at present your majesty will of course stay in
london for the present

certainly you will find me at the langham under the name of the
count von kramm

then shall drop you line to let you know how we progress

pray do so shall be all anxiety

then as to money

you have carte blanche

absolutely

tell you that would give one of the provinces of my kingdom
to have that photograph

and for present expenses

the king took heavy chamois leather bag from under his cloak
and laid it on the table

there are three hundred pounds in gold and seven hundred in
notes he said

holmes scribbled receipt upon sheet of his notebook and
handed it to him

and mademoiselles address he asked

is briony lodge serpentine avenue st johns wood

holmes took note of it one other question said he was the
photograph cabinet

it was

then goodnight your majesty and trust that we shall soon
have some good news for you and goodnight watson he added
as the wheels of the royal brougham rolled down the street if
you will be good enough to call tomorrow afternoon at three
oclock should like to chat this little matter over with you


ii

at three oclock precisely was at baker street but holmes had
not yet returned the landlady informed me that he had left the
house shortly after eight oclock in the morning sat down
beside the fire however with the intention of awaiting him
however long he might be was already deeply interested in his
inquiry for though it was surrounded by none of the grim and
strange features which were associated with the two crimes which
have already recorded still the nature of the case and the
exalted station of his client gave it character of its own
indeed apart from the nature of the investigation which my
friend had on hand there was something in his masterly grasp of
situation and his keen incisive reasoning which made it
pleasure to me to study his system of work and to follow the
quick subtle methods by which he disentangled the most
inextricable mysteries so accustomed was to his invariable
success that the very possibility of his failing had ceased to
enter into my head

it was close upon four before the door opened and
drunkenlooking groom illkempt and sidewhiskered with an
inflamed face and disreputable clothes walked into the room
accustomed as was to my friends amazing powers in the use of
disguises had to look three times before was certain that it
was indeed he with nod he vanished into the bedroom whence he
emerged in five minutes tweedsuited and respectable as of old
putting his hands into his pockets he stretched out his legs in
front of the fire and laughed heartily for some minutes

well really he cried and then he choked and laughed again
until he was obliged to lie back limp and helpless in the
chair

what is it

its quite too funny am sure you could never guess how
employed my morning or what ended by doing

cant imagine suppose that you have been watching the
habits and perhaps the house of miss irene adler

quite so but the sequel was rather unusual will tell you
however left the house little after eight oclock this
morning in the character of groom out of work there is
wonderful sympathy and freemasonry among horsey men be one of
them and you will know all that there is to know soon found
briony lodge it is bijou villa with garden at the back but
built out in front right up to the road two stories chubb lock
to the door large sittingroom on the right side well
furnished with long windows almost to the floor and those
preposterous english window fasteners which child could open
behind there was nothing remarkable save that the passage window
could be reached from the top of the coachhouse walked round
it and examined it closely from every point of view but without
noting anything else of interest

then lounged down the street and found as expected that
there was mews in lane which runs down by one wall of the
garden lent the ostlers hand in rubbing down their horses
and received in exchange twopence glass of half and half two
fills of shag tobacco and as much information as could desire
about miss adler to say nothing of half dozen other people in
the neighbourhood in whom was not in the least interested but
whose biographies was compelled to listen to

and what of irene adler asked

oh she has turned all the mens heads down in that part she is
the daintiest thing under bonnet on this planet so say the
serpentinemews to man she lives quietly sings at concerts
drives out at five every day and returns at seven sharp for
dinner seldom goes out at other times except when she sings
has only one male visitor but good deal of him he is dark
handsome and dashing never calls less than once day and
often twice he is mr godfrey norton of the inner temple see
the advantages of cabman as confidant they had driven him
home dozen times from serpentinemews and knew all about him
when had listened to all they had to tell began to walk up
and down near briony lodge once more and to think over my plan
of campaign

this godfrey norton was evidently an important factor in the
matter he was lawyer that sounded ominous what was the
relation between them and what the object of his repeated
visits was she his client his friend or his mistress if the
former she had probably transferred the photograph to his
keeping if the latter it was less likely on the issue of this
question depended whether should continue my work at briony
lodge or turn my attention to the gentlemans chambers in the
temple it was delicate point and it widened the field of my
inquiry fear that bore you with these details but have to
let you see my little difficulties if you are to understand the
situation

am following you closely answered

was still balancing the matter in my mind when hansom cab
drove up to briony lodge and gentleman sprang out he was
remarkably handsome man dark aquiline and moustachedevidently
the man of whom had heard he appeared to be in
great hurry shouted to the cabman to wait and brushed past the
maid who opened the door with the air of man who was thoroughly
at home

he was in the house about half an hour and could catch
glimpses of him in the windows of the sittingroom pacing up and
down talking excitedly and waving his arms of her could see
nothing presently he emerged looking even more flurried than
before as he stepped up to the cab he pulled gold watch from
his pocket and looked at it earnestly drive like the devil he
shouted first to gross hankeys in regent street and then to
the church of st monica in the edgeware road half guinea if
you do it in twenty minutes

away they went and was just wondering whether should not do
well to follow them when up the lane came neat little landau
the coachman with his coat only halfbuttoned and his tie under
his ear while all the tags of his harness were sticking out of
the buckles it hadnt pulled up before she shot out of the hall
door and into it only caught glimpse of her at the moment
but she was lovely woman with face that man might die for

the church of st monica john she cried and half
sovereign if you reach it in twenty minutes

this was quite too good to lose watson was just balancing
whether should run for it or whether should perch behind her
landau when cab came through the street the driver looked
twice at such shabby fare but jumped in before he could
object the church of st monica said and half sovereign
if you reach it in twenty minutes it was twentyfive minutes to
twelve and of course it was clear enough what was in the wind

my cabby drove fast dont think ever drove faster but the
others were there before us the cab and the landau with their
steaming horses were in front of the door when arrived paid
the man and hurried into the church there was not soul there
save the two whom had followed and surpliced clergyman who
seemed to be expostulating with them they were all three
standing in knot in front of the altar lounged up the side
aisle like any other idler who has dropped into church
suddenly to my surprise the three at the altar faced round to
me and godfrey norton came running as hard as he could towards
me

thank god he cried youll do come come

what then asked

come man come only three minutes or it wont be legal

was halfdragged up to the altar and before knew where was
found myself mumbling responses which were whispered in my ear
and vouching for things of which knew nothing and generally
assisting in the secure tying up of irene adler spinster to
godfrey norton bachelor it was all done in an instant and
there was the gentleman thanking me on the one side and the lady
on the other while the clergyman beamed on me in front it was
the most preposterous position in which ever found myself in my
life and it was the thought of it that started me laughing just
now it seems that there had been some informality about their
license that the clergyman absolutely refused to marry them
without witness of some sort and that my lucky appearance
saved the bridegroom from having to sally out into the streets in
search of best man the bride gave me sovereign and mean
to wear it on my watchchain in memory of the occasion

this is very unexpected turn of affairs said and what
then

well found my plans very seriously menaced it looked as if
the pair might take an immediate departure and so necessitate
very prompt and energetic measures on my part at the church
door however they separated he driving back to the temple and
she to her own house shall drive out in the park at five as
usual she said as she left him heard no more they drove
away in different directions and went off to make my own
arrangements

which are

some cold beef and glass of beer he answered ringing the
bell have been too busy to think of food and am likely to
be busier still this evening by the way doctor shall want
your cooperation

shall be delighted

you dont mind breaking the law

not in the least

nor running chance of arrest

not in good cause

oh the cause is excellent

then am your man

was sure that might rely on you

but what is it you wish

when mrs turner has brought in the tray will make it clear to
you now he said as he turned hungrily on the simple fare that
our landlady had provided must discuss it while eat for
have not much time it is nearly five now in two hours we must
be on the scene of action miss irene or madame rather returns
from her drive at seven we must be at briony lodge to meet her

and what then

you must leave that to me have already arranged what is to
occur there is only one point on which must insist you must
not interfere come what may you understand

am to be neutral

to do nothing whatever there will probably be some small
unpleasantness do not join in it it will end in my being
conveyed into the house four or five minutes afterwards the
sittingroom window will open you are to station yourself close
to that open window

yes

you are to watch me for will be visible to you

yes

and when raise my handsoyou will throw into the room what
give you to throw and will at the same time raise the cry of
fire you quite follow me

entirely

it is nothing very formidable he said taking long cigarshaped
roll from his pocket it is an ordinary plumbers smokerocket
fitted with cap at either end to make it selflighting
your task is confined to that when you raise your cry of fire
it will be taken up by quite number of people you may then
walk to the end of the street and will rejoin you in ten
minutes hope that have made myself clear

am to remain neutral to get near the window to watch you
and at the signal to throw in this object then to raise the cry
of fire and to wait you at the corner of the street

precisely

then you may entirely rely on me

that is excellent think perhaps it is almost time that
prepare for the new role have to play

he disappeared into his bedroom and returned in few minutes in
the character of an amiable and simpleminded nonconformist
clergyman his broad black hat his baggy trousers his white
tie his sympathetic smile and general look of peering and
benevolent curiosity were such as mr john hare alone could have
equalled it was not merely that holmes changed his costume his
expression his manner his very soul seemed to vary with every
fresh part that he assumed the stage lost fine actor even as
science lost an acute reasoner when he became specialist in
crime

it was quarter past six when we left baker street and it still
wanted ten minutes to the hour when we found ourselves in
serpentine avenue it was already dusk and the lamps were just
being lighted as we paced up and down in front of briony lodge
waiting for the coming of its occupant the house was just such
as had pictured it from sherlock holmes succinct description
but the locality appeared to be less private than expected on
the contrary for small street in quiet neighbourhood it was
remarkably animated there was group of shabbily dressed men
smoking and laughing in corner scissorsgrinder with his
wheel two guardsmen who were flirting with nursegirl and
several welldressed young men who were lounging up and down with
cigars in their mouths

you see remarked holmes as we paced to and fro in front of
the house this marriage rather simplifies matters the
photograph becomes doubleedged weapon now the chances are
that she would be as averse to its being seen by mr godfrey
norton as our client is to its coming to the eyes of his
princess now the question is where are we to find the
photograph

where indeed

it is most unlikely that she carries it about with her it is
cabinet size too large for easy concealment about womans
dress she knows that the king is capable of having her waylaid
and searched two attempts of the sort have already been made we
may take it then that she does not carry it about with her

where then

her banker or her lawyer there is that double possibility but
am inclined to think neither women are naturally secretive
and they like to do their own secreting why should she hand it
over to anyone else she could trust her own guardianship but
she could not tell what indirect or political influence might be
brought to bear upon business man besides remember that she
had resolved to use it within few days it must be where she
can lay her hands upon it it must be in her own house

but it has twice been burgled

pshaw they did not know how to look

but how will you look

will not look

what then

will get her to show me

but she will refuse

she will not be able to but hear the rumble of wheels it is
her carriage now carry out my orders to the letter

as he spoke the gleam of the sidelights of carriage came round
the curve of the avenue it was smart little landau which
rattled up to the door of briony lodge as it pulled up one of
the loafing men at the corner dashed forward to open the door in
the hope of earning copper but was elbowed away by another
loafer who had rushed up with the same intention fierce
quarrel broke out which was increased by the two guardsmen who
took sides with one of the loungers and by the scissorsgrinder
who was equally hot upon the other side blow was struck and
in an instant the lady who had stepped from her carriage was
the centre of little knot of flushed and struggling men who
struck savagely at each other with their fists and sticks holmes
dashed into the crowd to protect the lady but just as he reached
her he gave cry and dropped to the ground with the blood
running freely down his face at his fall the guardsmen took to
their heels in one direction and the loungers in the other while
number of betterdressed people who had watched the scuffle
without taking part in it crowded in to help the lady and to
attend to the injured man irene adler as will still call her
had hurried up the steps but she stood at the top with her
superb figure outlined against the lights of the hall looking
back into the street

is the poor gentleman much hurt she asked

he is dead cried several voices

no no theres life in him shouted another but hell be
gone before you can get him to hospital

hes brave fellow said woman they would have had the
ladys purse and watch if it hadnt been for him they were
gang and rough one too ah hes breathing now

he cant lie in the street may we bring him in marm

surely bring him into the sittingroom there is comfortable
sofa this way please

slowly and solemnly he was borne into briony lodge and laid out
in the principal room while still observed the proceedings
from my post by the window the lamps had been lit but the
blinds had not been drawn so that could see holmes as he lay
upon the couch do not know whether he was seized with
compunction at that moment for the part he was playing but
know that never felt more heartily ashamed of myself in my life
than when saw the beautiful creature against whom was
conspiring or the grace and kindliness with which she waited
upon the injured man and yet it would be the blackest treachery
to holmes to draw back now from the part which he had intrusted
to me hardened my heart and took the smokerocket from under
my ulster after all thought we are not injuring her we are
but preventing her from injuring another

holmes had sat up upon the couch and saw him motion like man
who is in need of air maid rushed across and threw open the
window at the same instant saw him raise his hand and at the
signal tossed my rocket into the room with cry of fire the
word was no sooner out of my mouth than the whole crowd of
spectators well dressed and illgentlemen ostlers and
servantmaidsjoined in general shriek of fire thick clouds
of smoke curled through the room and out at the open window
caught glimpse of rushing figures and moment later the voice
of holmes from within assuring them that it was false alarm
slipping through the shouting crowd made my way to the corner
of the street and in ten minutes was rejoiced to find my
friends arm in mine and to get away from the scene of uproar
he walked swiftly and in silence for some few minutes until we
had turned down one of the quiet streets which lead towards the
edgeware road

you did it very nicely doctor he remarked nothing could
have been better it is all right

you have the photograph

know where it is

and how did you find out

she showed me as told you she would

am still in the dark

do not wish to make mystery said he laughing the matter
was perfectly simple you of course saw that everyone in the
street was an accomplice they were all engaged for the evening

guessed as much

then when the row broke out had little moist red paint in
the palm of my hand rushed forward fell down clapped my hand
to my face and became piteous spectacle it is an old trick

that also could fathom

then they carried me in she was bound to have me in what else
could she do and into her sittingroom which was the very room
which suspected it lay between that and her bedroom and was
determined to see which they laid me on couch motioned for
air they were compelled to open the window and you had your
chance

how did that help you

it was allimportant when woman thinks that her house is on
fire her instinct is at once to rush to the thing which she
values most it is perfectly overpowering impulse and have
more than once taken advantage of it in the case of the
darlington substitution scandal it was of use to me and also in
the arnsworth castle business married woman grabs at her baby
an unmarried one reaches for her jewelbox now it was clear to
me that our lady of today had nothing in the house more precious
to her than what we are in quest of she would rush to secure it
the alarm of fire was admirably done the smoke and shouting were
enough to shake nerves of steel she responded beautifully the
photograph is in recess behind sliding panel just above the
right bellpull she was there in an instant and caught
glimpse of it as she halfdrew it out when cried out that it
was false alarm she replaced it glanced at the rocket rushed
from the room and have not seen her since rose and making
my excuses escaped from the house hesitated whether to
attempt to secure the photograph at once but the coachman had
come in and as he was watching me narrowly it seemed safer to
wait little overprecipitance may ruin all

and now asked

our quest is practically finished shall call with the king
tomorrow and with you if you care to come with us we will be
shown into the sittingroom to wait for the lady but it is
probable that when she comes she may find neither us nor the
photograph it might be satisfaction to his majesty to regain
it with his own hands

and when will you call

at eight in the morning she will not be up so that we shall
have clear field besides we must be prompt for this marriage
may mean complete change in her life and habits must wire to
the king without delay

we had reached baker street and had stopped at the door he was
searching his pockets for the key when someone passing said

goodnight mister sherlock holmes

there were several people on the pavement at the time but the
greeting appeared to come from slim youth in an ulster who had
hurried by

ive heard that voice before said holmes staring down the
dimly lit street now wonder who the deuce that could have
been


iii

slept at baker street that night and we were engaged upon our
toast and coffee in the morning when the king of bohemia rushed
into the room

you have really got it he cried grasping sherlock holmes by
either shoulder and looking eagerly into his face

not yet

but you have hopes

have hopes

then come am all impatience to be gone

we must have cab

no my brougham is waiting

then that will simplify matters we descended and started off
once more for briony lodge

irene adler is married remarked holmes

married when

yesterday

but to whom

to an english lawyer named norton

but she could not love him

am in hopes that she does

and why in hopes

because it would spare your majesty all fear of future
annoyance if the lady loves her husband she does not love your
majesty if she does not love your majesty there is no reason
why she should interfere with your majestys plan

it is true and yetwell wish she had been of my own
station what queen she would have made he relapsed into
moody silence which was not broken until we drew up in
serpentine avenue

the door of briony lodge was open and an elderly woman stood
upon the steps she watched us with sardonic eye as we stepped
from the brougham

mr sherlock holmes believe said she

am mr holmes answered my companion looking at her with
questioning and rather startled gaze

indeed my mistress told me that you were likely to call she
left this morning with her husband by the train from charing
cross for the continent

what sherlock holmes staggered back white with chagrin and
surprise do you mean that she has left england

never to return

and the papers asked the king hoarsely all is lost

we shall see he pushed past the servant and rushed into the
drawingroom followed by the king and myself the furniture was
scattered about in every direction with dismantled shelves and
open drawers as if the lady had hurriedly ransacked them before
her flight holmes rushed at the bellpull tore back small
sliding shutter and plunging in his hand pulled out
photograph and letter the photograph was of irene adler
herself in evening dress the letter was superscribed to
sherlock holmes esq to be left till called for my friend
tore it open and we all three read it together it was dated at
midnight of the preceding night and ran in this way

my dear mr sherlock holmesyou really did it very well you
took me in completely until after the alarm of fire had not
suspicion but then when found how had betrayed myself
began to think had been warned against you months ago had
been told that if the king employed an agent it would certainly
be you and your address had been given me yet with all this
you made me reveal what you wanted to know even after became
suspicious found it hard to think evil of such dear kind
old clergyman but you know have been trained as an actress
myself male costume is nothing new to me often take advantage
of the freedom which it gives sent john the coachman to
watch you ran up stairs got into my walkingclothes as call
them and came down just as you departed

well followed you to your door and so made sure that was
really an object of interest to the celebrated mr sherlock
holmes then rather imprudently wished you goodnight and
started for the temple to see my husband

we both thought the best resource was flight when pursued by
so formidable an antagonist so you will find the nest empty when
you call tomorrow as to the photograph your client may rest in
peace love and am loved by better man than he the king may
do what he will without hindrance from one whom he has cruelly
wronged keep it only to safeguard myself and to preserve
weapon which will always secure me from any steps which he might
take in the future leave photograph which he might care to
possess and remain dear mr sherlock holmes

very truly yours
irene norton adler

what womanoh what woman cried the king of bohemia when
we had all three read this epistle did not tell you how quick
and resolute she was would she not have made an admirable queen
is it not pity that she was not on my level

from what have seen of the lady she seems indeed to be on
very different level to your majesty said holmes coldly am
sorry that have not been able to bring your majestys business
to more successful conclusion

on the contrary my dear sir cried the king nothing could be
more successful know that her word is inviolate the
photograph is now as safe as if it were in the fire

am glad to hear your majesty say so

am immensely indebted to you pray tell me in what way can
reward you this ring he slipped an emerald snake ring from
his finger and held it out upon the palm of his hand

your majesty has something which should value even more
highly said holmes

you have but to name it

this photograph

the king stared at him in amazement

irenes photograph he cried certainly if you wish it

thank your majesty then there is no more to be done in the
matter have the honour to wish you very goodmorning he
bowed and turning away without observing the hand which the
king had stretched out to him he set off in my company for his
chambers

and that was how great scandal threatened to affect the kingdom
of bohemia and how the best plans of mr sherlock holmes were
beaten by womans wit he used to make merry over the
cleverness of women but have not heard him do it of late and
when he speaks of irene adler or when he refers to her
photograph it is always under the honourable title of the woman



adventure ii the redheaded league

had called upon my friend mr sherlock holmes one day in the
autumn of last year and found him in deep conversation with
very stout floridfaced elderly gentleman with fiery red hair
with an apology for my intrusion was about to withdraw when
holmes pulled me abruptly into the room and closed the door
behind me

you could not possibly have come at better time my dear
watson he said cordially

was afraid that you were engaged

so am very much so

then can wait in the next room

not at all this gentleman mr wilson has been my partner and
helper in many of my most successful cases and have no
doubt that he will be of the utmost use to me in yours also

the stout gentleman half rose from his chair and gave bob of
greeting with quick little questioning glance from his small
fatencircled eyes

try the settee said holmes relapsing into his armchair and
putting his fingertips together as was his custom when in
judicial moods know my dear watson that you share my love
of all that is bizarre and outside the conventions and humdrum
routine of everyday life you have shown your relish for it by
the enthusiasm which has prompted you to chronicle and if you
will excuse my saying so somewhat to embellish so many of my own
little adventures

your cases have indeed been of the greatest interest to me
observed

you will remember that remarked the other day just before we
went into the very simple problem presented by miss mary
sutherland that for strange effects and extraordinary
combinations we must go to life itself which is always far more
daring than any effort of the imagination

proposition which took the liberty of doubting

you did doctor but none the less you must come round to my
view for otherwise shall keep on piling fact upon fact on you
until your reason breaks down under them and acknowledges me to
be right now mr jabez wilson here has been good enough to call
upon me this morning and to begin narrative which promises to
be one of the most singular which have listened to for some
time you have heard me remark that the strangest and most unique
things are very often connected not with the larger but with the
smaller crimes and occasionally indeed where there is room for
doubt whether any positive crime has been committed as far as
have heard it is impossible for me to say whether the present
case is an instance of crime or not but the course of events is
certainly among the most singular that have ever listened to
perhaps mr wilson you would have the great kindness to
recommence your narrative ask you not merely because my friend
dr watson has not heard the opening part but also because the
peculiar nature of the story makes me anxious to have every
possible detail from your lips as rule when have heard some
slight indication of the course of events am able to guide
myself by the thousands of other similar cases which occur to my
memory in the present instance am forced to admit that the
facts are to the best of my belief unique

the portly client puffed out his chest with an appearance of some
little pride and pulled dirty and wrinkled newspaper from the
inside pocket of his greatcoat as he glanced down the
advertisement column with his head thrust forward and the paper
flattened out upon his knee took good look at the man and
endeavoured after the fashion of my companion to read the
indications which might be presented by his dress or appearance

did not gain very much however by my inspection our visitor
bore every mark of being an average commonplace british
tradesman obese pompous and slow he wore rather baggy grey
shepherds check trousers not overclean black frockcoat
unbuttoned in the front and drab waistcoat with heavy brassy
albert chain and square pierced bit of metal dangling down as
an ornament frayed tophat and faded brown overcoat with
wrinkled velvet collar lay upon chair beside him altogether
look as would there was nothing remarkable about the man save
his blazing red head and the expression of extreme chagrin and
discontent upon his features

sherlock holmes quick eye took in my occupation and he shook
his head with smile as he noticed my questioning glances
beyond the obvious facts that he has at some time done manual
labour that he takes snuff that he is freemason that he has
been in china and that he has done considerable amount of
writing lately can deduce nothing else

mr jabez wilson started up in his chair with his forefinger
upon the paper but his eyes upon my companion

how in the name of goodfortune did you know all that mr
holmes he asked how did you know for example that did
manual labour its as true as gospel for began as ships
carpenter

your hands my dear sir your right hand is quite size larger
than your left you have worked with it and the muscles are more
developed

well the snuff then and the freemasonry

wont insult your intelligence by telling you how read that
especially as rather against the strict rules of your order you
use an arcandcompass breastpin

ah of course forgot that but the writing

what else can be indicated by that right cuff so very shiny for
five inches and the left one with the smooth patch near the
elbow where you rest it upon the desk

well but china

the fish that you have tattooed immediately above your right
wrist could only have been done in china have made small
study of tattoo marks and have even contributed to the literature
of the subject that trick of staining the fishes scales of
delicate pink is quite peculiar to china when in addition
see chinese coin hanging from your watchchain the matter
becomes even more simple

mr jabez wilson laughed heavily well never said he
thought at first that you had done something clever but see
that there was nothing in it after all

begin to think watson said holmes that make mistake
in explaining omne ignotum pro magnifico you know and my
poor little reputation such as it is will suffer shipwreck if
am so candid can you not find the advertisement mr wilson

yes have got it now he answered with his thick red finger
planted halfway down the column here it is this is what began
it all you just read it for yourself sir

took the paper from him and read as follows

to the redheaded league on account of the bequest of the late
ezekiah hopkins of lebanon pennsylvania there is now
another vacancy open which entitles member of the league to
salary of pounds week for purely nominal services all
redheaded men who are sound in body and mind and above the age
of twentyone years are eligible apply in person on monday at
eleven oclock to duncan ross at the offices of the league
popes court fleet street

what on earth does this mean ejaculated after had twice
read over the extraordinary announcement

holmes chuckled and wriggled in his chair as was his habit when
in high spirits it is little off the beaten track isnt it
said he and now mr wilson off you go at scratch and tell us
all about yourself your household and the effect which this
advertisement had upon your fortunes you will first make note
doctor of the paper and the date

it is the morning chronicle of april just two months
ago

very good now mr wilson

well it is just as have been telling you mr sherlock
holmes said jabez wilson mopping his forehead have small
pawnbrokers business at coburg square near the city its not
very large affair and of late years it has not done more than
just give me living used to be able to keep two assistants
but now only keep one and would have job to pay him but
that he is willing to come for half wages so as to learn the
business

what is the name of this obliging youth asked sherlock holmes

his name is vincent spaulding and hes not such youth
either its hard to say his age should not wish smarter
assistant mr holmes and know very well that he could better
himself and earn twice what am able to give him but after
all if he is satisfied why should put ideas in his head

why indeed you seem most fortunate in having an who
comes under the full market price it is not common experience
among employers in this age dont know that your assistant is
not as remarkable as your advertisement

oh he has his faults too said mr wilson never was such
fellow for photography snapping away with camera when he ought
to be improving his mind and then diving down into the cellar
like rabbit into its hole to develop his pictures that is his
main fault but on the whole hes good worker theres no vice
in him

he is still with you presume

yes sir he and girl of fourteen who does bit of simple
cooking and keeps the place cleanthats all have in the
house for am widower and never had any family we live very
quietly sir the three of us and we keep roof over our heads
and pay our debts if we do nothing more

the first thing that put us out was that advertisement
spaulding he came down into the office just this day eight
weeks with this very paper in his hand and he says

wish to the lord mr wilson that was redheaded man

why that asks

why says he heres another vacancy on the league of the
redheaded men its worth quite little fortune to any man who
gets it and understand that there are more vacancies than
there are men so that the trustees are at their wits end what
to do with the money if my hair would only change colour heres
nice little crib all ready for me to step into

why what is it then asked you see mr holmes am
very stayathome man and as my business came to me instead of
my having to go to it was often weeks on end without putting
my foot over the doormat in that way didnt know much of what
was going on outside and was always glad of bit of news

have you never heard of the league of the redheaded men he
asked with his eyes open

never

why wonder at that for you are eligible yourself for one
of the vacancies

and what are they worth asked

oh merely couple of hundred year but the work is slight
and it need not interfere very much with ones other
occupations

well you can easily think that that made me prick up my ears
for the business has not been overgood for some years and an
extra couple of hundred would have been very handy

tell me all about it said

well said he showing me the advertisement you can see for
yourself that the league has vacancy and there is the address
where you should apply for particulars as far as can make out
the league was founded by an american millionaire ezekiah
hopkins who was very peculiar in his ways he was himself
redheaded and he had great sympathy for all redheaded men
so when he died it was found that he had left his enormous
fortune in the hands of trustees with instructions to apply the
interest to the providing of easy berths to men whose hair is of
that colour from all hear it is splendid pay and very little to
do

but said there would be millions of redheaded men who
would apply

not so many as you might think he answered you see it is
really confined to londoners and to grown men this american had
started from london when he was young and he wanted to do the
old town good turn then again have heard it is no use your
applying if your hair is light red or dark red or anything but
real bright blazing fiery red now if you cared to apply mr
wilson you would just walk in but perhaps it would hardly be
worth your while to put yourself out of the way for the sake of
few hundred pounds

now it is fact gentlemen as you may see for yourselves
that my hair is of very full and rich tint so that it seemed
to me that if there was to be any competition in the matter
stood as good chance as any man that had ever met vincent
spaulding seemed to know so much about it that thought he might
prove useful so just ordered him to put up the shutters for
the day and to come right away with me he was very willing to
have holiday so we shut the business up and started off for
the address that was given us in the advertisement

never hope to see such sight as that again mr holmes from
north south east and west every man who had shade of red in
his hair had tramped into the city to answer the advertisement
fleet street was choked with redheaded folk and popes court
looked like costers orange barrow should not have thought
there were so many in the whole country as were brought together
by that single advertisement every shade of colour they
werestraw lemon orange brick irishsetter liver clay
but as spaulding said there were not many who had the real
vivid flamecoloured tint when saw how many were waiting
would have given it up in despair but spaulding would not hear
of it how he did it could not imagine but he pushed and
pulled and butted until he got me through the crowd and right up
to the steps which led to the office there was double stream
upon the stair some going up in hope and some coming back
dejected but we wedged in as well as we could and soon found
ourselves in the office

your experience has been most entertaining one remarked
holmes as his client paused and refreshed his memory with huge
pinch of snuff pray continue your very interesting statement

there was nothing in the office but couple of wooden chairs
and deal table behind which sat small man with head that
was even redder than mine he said few words to each candidate
as he came up and then he always managed to find some fault in
them which would disqualify them getting vacancy did not seem
to be such very easy matter after all however when our turn
came the little man was much more favourable to me than to any of
the others and he closed the door as we entered so that he
might have private word with us

this is mr jabez wilson said my assistant and he is
willing to fill vacancy in the league

and he is admirably suited for it the other answered he has
every requirement cannot recall when have seen anything so
fine he took step backward cocked his head on one side and
gazed at my hair until felt quite bashful then suddenly he
plunged forward wrung my hand and congratulated me warmly on my
success

it would be injustice to hesitate said he you will
however am sure excuse me for taking an obvious precaution
with that he seized my hair in both his hands and tugged until
yelled with the pain there is water in your eyes said he as
he released me perceive that all is as it should be but we
have to be careful for we have twice been deceived by wigs and
once by paint could tell you tales of cobblers wax which
would disgust you with human nature he stepped over to the
window and shouted through it at the top of his voice that the
vacancy was filled groan of disappointment came up from below
and the folk all trooped away in different directions until there
was not redhead to be seen except my own and that of the
manager

my name said he is mr duncan ross and am myself one of
the pensioners upon the fund left by our noble benefactor are
you married man mr wilson have you family

answered that had not

his face fell immediately

dear me he said gravely that is very serious indeed am
sorry to hear you say that the fund was of course for the
propagation and spread of the redheads as well as for their
maintenance it is exceedingly unfortunate that you should be
bachelor

my face lengthened at this mr holmes for thought that was
not to have the vacancy after all but after thinking it over for
few minutes he said that it would be all right

in the case of another said he the objection might be
fatal but we must stretch point in favour of man with such
head of hair as yours when shall you be able to enter upon your
new duties

well it is little awkward for have business already
said

oh never mind about that mr wilson said vincent spaulding
should be able to look after that for you

what would be the hours asked

ten to two

now pawnbrokers business is mostly done of an evening mr
holmes especially thursday and friday evening which is just
before payday so it would suit me very well to earn little in
the mornings besides knew that my assistant was good man
and that he would see to anything that turned up

that would suit me very well said and the pay

is pounds week

and the work

is purely nominal

what do you call purely nominal

well you have to be in the office or at least in the
building the whole time if you leave you forfeit your whole
position forever the will is very clear upon that point you
dont comply with the conditions if you budge from the office
during that time

its only four hours day and should not think of leaving
said

no excuse will avail said mr duncan ross neither sickness
nor business nor anything else there you must stay or you lose
your billet

and the work

is to copy out the encyclopaedia britannica there is the first
volume of it in that press you must find your own ink pens and
blottingpaper but we provide this table and chair will you be
ready tomorrow

certainly answered

then goodbye mr jabez wilson and let me congratulate you
once more on the important position which you have been fortunate
enough to gain he bowed me out of the room and went home with
my assistant hardly knowing what to say or do was so pleased
at my own good fortune

well thought over the matter all day and by evening was in
low spirits again for had quite persuaded myself that the
whole affair must be some great hoax or fraud though what its
object might be could not imagine it seemed altogether past
belief that anyone could make such will or that they would pay
such sum for doing anything so simple as copying out the
encyclopaedia britannica vincent spaulding did what he could to
cheer me up but by bedtime had reasoned myself out of the
whole thing however in the morning determined to have look
at it anyhow so bought penny bottle of ink and with
quillpen and seven sheets of foolscap paper started off for
popes court

well to my surprise and delight everything was as right as
possible the table was set out ready for me and mr duncan ross
was there to see that got fairly to work he started me off
upon the letter and then he left me but he would drop in from
time to time to see that all was right with me at two oclock he
bade me goodday complimented me upon the amount that had
written and locked the door of the office after me

this went on day after day mr holmes and on saturday the
manager came in and planked down four golden sovereigns for my
weeks work it was the same next week and the same the week
after every morning was there at ten and every afternoon
left at two by degrees mr duncan ross took to coming in only
once of morning and then after time he did not come in at
all still of course never dared to leave the room for an
instant for was not sure when he might come and the billet
was such good one and suited me so well that would not risk
the loss of it

eight weeks passed away like this and had written about
abbots and archery and armour and architecture and attica and
hoped with diligence that might get on to the bs before very
long it cost me something in foolscap and had pretty nearly
filled shelf with my writings and then suddenly the whole
business came to an end

to an end

yes sir and no later than this morning went to my work as
usual at ten oclock but the door was shut and locked with
little square of cardboard hammered on to the middle of the
panel with tack here it is and you can read for yourself

he held up piece of white cardboard about the size of sheet
of notepaper it read in this fashion

the redheaded league

is

dissolved

october

sherlock holmes and surveyed this curt announcement and the
rueful face behind it until the comical side of the affair so
completely overtopped every other consideration that we both
burst out into roar of laughter

cannot see that there is anything very funny cried our
client flushing up to the roots of his flaming head if you can
do nothing better than laugh at me can go elsewhere

no no cried holmes shoving him back into the chair from
which he had half risen really wouldnt miss your case for
the world it is most refreshingly unusual but there is if you
will excuse my saying so something just little funny about it
pray what steps did you take when you found the card upon the
door

was staggered sir did not know what to do then called
at the offices round but none of them seemed to know anything
about it finally went to the landlord who is an accountant
living on the groundfloor and asked him if he could tell me
what had become of the redheaded league he said that he had
never heard of any such body then asked him who mr duncan
ross was he answered that the name was new to him

well said the gentleman at no

what the redheaded man

yes

oh said he his name was william morris he was solicitor
and was using my room as temporary convenience until his new
premises were ready he moved out yesterday

where could find him

oh at his new offices he did tell me the address yes
king edward street near st pauls

started off mr holmes but when got to that address it was
manufactory of artificial kneecaps and no one in it had ever
heard of either mr william morris or mr duncan ross

and what did you do then asked holmes

went home to saxecoburg square and took the advice of my
assistant but he could not help me in any way he could only say
that if waited should hear by post but that was not quite
good enough mr holmes did not wish to lose such place
without struggle so as had heard that you were good enough
to give advice to poor folk who were in need of it came right
away to you

and you did very wisely said holmes your case is an
exceedingly remarkable one and shall be happy to look into it
from what you have told me think that it is possible that
graver issues hang from it than might at first sight appear

grave enough said mr jabez wilson why have lost four
pound week

as far as you are personally concerned remarked holmes do
not see that you have any grievance against this extraordinary
league on the contrary you are as understand richer by some
pounds to say nothing of the minute knowledge which you have
gained on every subject which comes under the letter you have
lost nothing by them

no sir but want to find out about them and who they are
and what their object was in playing this prankif it was
prankupon me it was pretty expensive joke for them for it
cost them two and thirty pounds

we shall endeavour to clear up these points for you and first
one or two questions mr wilson this assistant of yours who
first called your attention to the advertisementhow long had he
been with you

about month then

how did he come

in answer to an advertisement

was he the only applicant

no had dozen

why did you pick him

because he was handy and would come cheap

at halfwages in fact

yes

what is he like this vincent spaulding

small stoutbuilt very quick in his ways no hair on his face
though hes not short of thirty has white splash of acid upon
his forehead

holmes sat up in his chair in considerable excitement thought
as much said he have you ever observed that his ears are
pierced for earrings

yes sir he told me that gipsy had done it for him when he
was lad

hum said holmes sinking back in deep thought he is still
with you

oh yes sir have only just left him

and has your business been attended to in your absence

nothing to complain of sir theres never very much to do of
morning

that will do mr wilson shall be happy to give you an
opinion upon the subject in the course of day or two today is
saturday and hope that by monday we may come to conclusion

well watson said holmes when our visitor had left us what
do you make of it all

make nothing of it answered frankly it is most
mysterious business

as rule said holmes the more bizarre thing is the less
mysterious it proves to be it is your commonplace featureless
crimes which are really puzzling just as commonplace face is
the most difficult to identify but must be prompt over this
matter

what are you going to do then asked

to smoke he answered it is quite three pipe problem and
beg that you wont speak to me for fifty minutes he curled
himself up in his chair with his thin knees drawn up to his
hawklike nose and there he sat with his eyes closed and his
black clay pipe thrusting out like the bill of some strange bird
had come to the conclusion that he had dropped asleep and
indeed was nodding myself when he suddenly sprang out of his
chair with the gesture of man who has made up his mind and put
his pipe down upon the mantelpiece

sarasate plays at the st jamess hall this afternoon he
remarked what do you think watson could your patients spare
you for few hours

have nothing to do today my practice is never very
absorbing

then put on your hat and come am going through the city
first and we can have some lunch on the way observe that
there is good deal of german music on the programme which is
rather more to my taste than italian or french it is
introspective and want to introspect come along

we travelled by the underground as far as aldersgate and short
walk took us to saxecoburg square the scene of the singular
story which we had listened to in the morning it was poky
little shabbygenteel place where four lines of dingy
twostoried brick houses looked out into small railedin
enclosure where lawn of weedy grass and few clumps of faded
laurelbushes made hard fight against smokeladen and
uncongenial atmosphere three gilt balls and brown board with
jabez wilson in white letters upon corner house announced
the place where our redheaded client carried on his business
sherlock holmes stopped in front of it with his head on one side
and looked it all over with his eyes shining brightly between
puckered lids then he walked slowly up the street and then down
again to the corner still looking keenly at the houses finally
he returned to the pawnbrokers and having thumped vigorously
upon the pavement with his stick two or three times he went up
to the door and knocked it was instantly opened by
brightlooking cleanshaven young fellow who asked him to step
in

thank you said holmes only wished to ask you how you would
go from here to the strand

third right fourth left answered the assistant promptly
closing the door

smart fellow that observed holmes as we walked away he is
in my judgment the fourth smartest man in london and for daring
am not sure that he has not claim to be third have known
something of him before

evidently said mr wilsons assistant counts for good
deal in this mystery of the redheaded league am sure that you
inquired your way merely in order that you might see him

not him

what then

the knees of his trousers

and what did you see

what expected to see

why did you beat the pavement

my dear doctor this is time for observation not for talk we
are spies in an enemys country we know something of saxecoburg
square let us now explore the parts which lie behind it

the road in which we found ourselves as we turned round the
corner from the retired saxecoburg square presented as great
contrast to it as the front of picture does to the back it was
one of the main arteries which conveyed the traffic of the city
to the north and west the roadway was blocked with the immense
stream of commerce flowing in double tide inward and outward
while the footpaths were black with the hurrying swarm of
pedestrians it was difficult to realise as we looked at the line
of fine shops and stately business premises that they really
abutted on the other side upon the faded and stagnant square
which we had just quitted

let me see said holmes standing at the corner and glancing
along the line should like just to remember the order of the
houses here it is hobby of mine to have an exact knowledge of
london there is mortimers the tobacconist the little
newspaper shop the coburg branch of the city and suburban bank
the vegetarian restaurant and mcfarlanes carriagebuilding
depot that carries us right on to the other block and now
doctor weve done our work so its time we had some play
sandwich and cup of coffee and then off to violinland where
all is sweetness and delicacy and harmony and there are no
redheaded clients to vex us with their conundrums

my friend was an enthusiastic musician being himself not only
very capable performer but composer of no ordinary merit all
the afternoon he sat in the stalls wrapped in the most perfect
happiness gently waving his long thin fingers in time to the
music while his gently smiling face and his languid dreamy eyes
were as unlike those of holmes the sleuthhound holmes the
relentless keenwitted readyhanded criminal agent as it was
possible to conceive in his singular character the dual nature
alternately asserted itself and his extreme exactness and
astuteness represented as have often thought the reaction
against the poetic and contemplative mood which occasionally
predominated in him the swing of his nature took him from
extreme languor to devouring energy and as knew well he was
never so truly formidable as when for days on end he had been
lounging in his armchair amid his improvisations and his
blackletter editions then it was that the lust of the chase
would suddenly come upon him and that his brilliant reasoning
power would rise to the level of intuition until those who were
unacquainted with his methods would look askance at him as on
man whose knowledge was not that of other mortals when saw him
that afternoon so enwrapped in the music at st jamess hall
felt that an evil time might be coming upon those whom he had set
himself to hunt down

you want to go home no doubt doctor he remarked as we
emerged

yes it would be as well

and have some business to do which will take some hours this
business at coburg square is serious

why serious

considerable crime is in contemplation have every reason to
believe that we shall be in time to stop it but today being
saturday rather complicates matters shall want your help
tonight

at what time

ten will be early enough

shall be at baker street at ten

very well and say doctor there may be some little danger
so kindly put your army revolver in your pocket he waved his
hand turned on his heel and disappeared in an instant among the
crowd

trust that am not more dense than my neighbours but was
always oppressed with sense of my own stupidity in my dealings
with sherlock holmes here had heard what he had heard had
seen what he had seen and yet from his words it was evident that
he saw clearly not only what had happened but what was about to
happen while to me the whole business was still confused and
grotesque as drove home to my house in kensington thought
over it all from the extraordinary story of the redheaded
copier of the encyclopaedia down to the visit to saxecoburg
square and the ominous words with which he had parted from me
what was this nocturnal expedition and why should go armed
where were we going and what were we to do had the hint from
holmes that this smoothfaced pawnbrokers assistant was
formidable mana man who might play deep game tried to
puzzle it out but gave it up in despair and set the matter aside
until night should bring an explanation

it was quarterpast nine when started from home and made my
way across the park and so through oxford street to baker
street two hansoms were standing at the door and as entered
the passage heard the sound of voices from above on entering
his room found holmes in animated conversation with two men
one of whom recognised as peter jones the official police
agent while the other was long thin sadfaced man with
very shiny hat and oppressively respectable frockcoat

ha our party is complete said holmes buttoning up his
peajacket and taking his heavy hunting crop from the rack
watson think you know mr jones of scotland yard let me
introduce you to mr merryweather who is to be our companion in
tonights adventure

were hunting in couples again doctor you see said jones in
his consequential way our friend here is wonderful man for
starting chase all he wants is an old dog to help him to do
the running down

hope wild goose may not prove to be the end of our chase
observed mr merryweather gloomily

you may place considerable confidence in mr holmes sir said
the police agent loftily he has his own little methods which
are if he wont mind my saying so just little too theoretical
and fantastic but he has the makings of detective in him it
is not too much to say that once or twice as in that business of
the sholto murder and the agra treasure he has been more nearly
correct than the official force

oh if you say so mr jones it is all right said the
stranger with deference still confess that miss my rubber
it is the first saturday night for sevenandtwenty years that
have not had my rubber

think you will find said sherlock holmes that you will
play for higher stake tonight than you have ever done yet and
that the play will be more exciting for you mr merryweather
the stake will be some pounds and for you jones it will
be the man upon whom you wish to lay your hands

john clay the murderer thief smasher and forger hes
young man mr merryweather but he is at the head of his
profession and would rather have my bracelets on him than on
any criminal in london hes remarkable man is young john
clay his grandfather was royal duke and he himself has been
to eton and oxford his brain is as cunning as his fingers and
though we meet signs of him at every turn we never know where to
find the man himself hell crack crib in scotland one week
and be raising money to build an orphanage in cornwall the next
ive been on his track for years and have never set eyes on him
yet

hope that may have the pleasure of introducing you tonight
ive had one or two little turns also with mr john clay and
agree with you that he is at the head of his profession it is
past ten however and quite time that we started if you two
will take the first hansom watson and will follow in the
second

sherlock holmes was not very communicative during the long drive
and lay back in the cab humming the tunes which he had heard in
the afternoon we rattled through an endless labyrinth of gaslit
streets until we emerged into farrington street

we are close there now my friend remarked this fellow
merryweather is bank director and personally interested in the
matter thought it as well to have jones with us also he is
not bad fellow though an absolute imbecile in his profession
he has one positive virtue he is as brave as bulldog and as
tenacious as lobster if he gets his claws upon anyone here we
are and they are waiting for us

we had reached the same crowded thoroughfare in which we had
found ourselves in the morning our cabs were dismissed and
following the guidance of mr merryweather we passed down
narrow passage and through side door which he opened for us
within there was small corridor which ended in very massive
iron gate this also was opened and led down flight of winding
stone steps which terminated at another formidable gate mr
merryweather stopped to light lantern and then conducted us
down dark earthsmelling passage and so after opening
third door into huge vault or cellar which was piled all
round with crates and massive boxes

you are not very vulnerable from above holmes remarked as he
held up the lantern and gazed about him

nor from below said mr merryweather striking his stick upon
the flags which lined the floor why dear me it sounds quite
hollow he remarked looking up in surprise

must really ask you to be little more quiet said holmes
severely you have already imperilled the whole success of our
expedition might beg that you would have the goodness to sit
down upon one of those boxes and not to interfere

the solemn mr merryweather perched himself upon crate with
very injured expression upon his face while holmes fell upon his
knees upon the floor and with the lantern and magnifying lens
began to examine minutely the cracks between the stones few
seconds sufficed to satisfy him for he sprang to his feet again
and put his glass in his pocket

we have at least an hour before us he remarked for they can
hardly take any steps until the good pawnbroker is safely in bed
then they will not lose minute for the sooner they do their
work the longer time they will have for their escape we are at
present doctoras no doubt you have divinedin the cellar of
the city branch of one of the principal london banks mr
merryweather is the chairman of directors and he will explain to
you that there are reasons why the more daring criminals of
london should take considerable interest in this cellar at
present

it is our french gold whispered the director we have had
several warnings that an attempt might be made upon it

your french gold

yes we had occasion some months ago to strengthen our resources
and borrowed for that purpose napoleons from the bank of
france it has become known that we have never had occasion to
unpack the money and that it is still lying in our cellar the
crate upon which sit contains napoleons packed between
layers of lead foil our reserve of bullion is much larger at
present than is usually kept in single branch office and the
directors have had misgivings upon the subject

which were very well justified observed holmes and now it is
time that we arranged our little plans expect that within an
hour matters will come to head in the meantime mr
merryweather we must put the screen over that dark lantern

and sit in the dark

am afraid so had brought pack of cards in my pocket and
thought that as we were partie you might have your
rubber after all but see that the enemys preparations have
gone so far that we cannot risk the presence of light and
first of all we must choose our positions these are daring men
and though we shall take them at disadvantage they may do us
some harm unless we are careful shall stand behind this crate
and do you conceal yourselves behind those then when flash
light upon them close in swiftly if they fire watson have no
compunction about shooting them down

placed my revolver cocked upon the top of the wooden case
behind which crouched holmes shot the slide across the front
of his lantern and left us in pitch darknesssuch an absolute
darkness as have never before experienced the smell of hot
metal remained to assure us that the light was still there ready
to flash out at moments notice to me with my nerves worked
up to pitch of expectancy there was something depressing and
subduing in the sudden gloom and in the cold dank air of the
vault

they have but one retreat whispered holmes that is back
through the house into saxecoburg square hope that you have
done what asked you jones

have an inspector and two officers waiting at the front door

then we have stopped all the holes and now we must be silent
and wait

what time it seemed from comparing notes afterwards it was but
an hour and quarter yet it appeared to me that the night must
have almost gone and the dawn be breaking above us my limbs
were weary and stiff for feared to change my position yet my
nerves were worked up to the highest pitch of tension and my
hearing was so acute that could not only hear the gentle
breathing of my companions but could distinguish the deeper
heavier inbreath of the bulky jones from the thin sighing note
of the bank director from my position could look over the case
in the direction of the floor suddenly my eyes caught the glint
of light

at first it was but lurid spark upon the stone pavement then
it lengthened out until it became yellow line and then
without any warning or sound gash seemed to open and hand
appeared white almost womanly hand which felt about in the
centre of the little area of light for minute or more the
hand with its writhing fingers protruded out of the floor then
it was withdrawn as suddenly as it appeared and all was dark
again save the single lurid spark which marked chink between
the stones

its disappearance however was but momentary with rending
tearing sound one of the broad white stones turned over upon
its side and left square gaping hole through which streamed
the light of lantern over the edge there peeped cleancut
boyish face which looked keenly about it and then with hand
on either side of the aperture drew itself shoulderhigh and
waisthigh until one knee rested upon the edge in another
instant he stood at the side of the hole and was hauling after
him companion lithe and small like himself with pale face
and shock of very red hair

its all clear he whispered have you the chisel and the
bags great scott jump archie jump and ill swing for it

sherlock holmes had sprung out and seized the intruder by the
collar the other dived down the hole and heard the sound of
rending cloth as jones clutched at his skirts the light flashed
upon the barrel of revolver but holmes hunting crop came
down on the mans wrist and the pistol clinked upon the stone
floor

its no use john clay said holmes blandly you have no
chance at all

so see the other answered with the utmost coolness fancy
that my pal is all right though see you have got his
coattails

there are three men waiting for him at the door said holmes

oh indeed you seem to have done the thing very completely
must compliment you

and you holmes answered your redheaded idea was very new
and effective

youll see your pal again presently said jones hes quicker
at climbing down holes than am just hold out while fix the
derbies

beg that you will not touch me with your filthy hands
remarked our prisoner as the handcuffs clattered upon his wrists
you may not be aware that have royal blood in my veins have
the goodness also when you address me always to say sir and
please

all right said jones with stare and snigger well would
you please sir march upstairs where we can get cab to carry
your highness to the policestation

that is better said john clay serenely he made sweeping bow
to the three of us and walked quietly off in the custody of the
detective

really mr holmes said mr merryweather as we followed them
from the cellar do not know how the bank can thank you or
repay you there is no doubt that you have detected and defeated
in the most complete manner one of the most determined attempts
at bank robbery that have ever come within my experience

have had one or two little scores of my own to settle with mr
john clay said holmes have been at some small expense over
this matter which shall expect the bank to refund but beyond
that am amply repaid by having had an experience which is in
many ways unique and by hearing the very remarkable narrative of
the redheaded league


you see watson he explained in the early hours of the morning
as we sat over glass of whisky and soda in baker street it
was perfectly obvious from the first that the only possible
object of this rather fantastic business of the advertisement of
the league and the copying of the encyclopaedia must be to get
this not overbright pawnbroker out of the way for number of
hours every day it was curious way of managing it but
really it would be difficult to suggest better the method was
no doubt suggested to clays ingenious mind by the colour of his
accomplices hair the pounds week was lure which must draw
him and what was it to them who were playing for thousands
they put in the advertisement one rogue has the temporary
office the other rogue incites the man to apply for it and
together they manage to secure his absence every morning in the
week from the time that heard of the assistant having come for
half wages it was obvious to me that he had some strong motive
for securing the situation

but how could you guess what the motive was

had there been women in the house should have suspected
mere vulgar intrigue that however was out of the question the
mans business was small one and there was nothing in his
house which could account for such elaborate preparations and
such an expenditure as they were at it must then be something
out of the house what could it be thought of the assistants
fondness for photography and his trick of vanishing into the
cellar the cellar there was the end of this tangled clue then
made inquiries as to this mysterious assistant and found that
had to deal with one of the coolest and most daring criminals in
london he was doing something in the cellarsomething which
took many hours day for months on end what could it be once
more could think of nothing save that he was running tunnel
to some other building

so far had got when we went to visit the scene of action
surprised you by beating upon the pavement with my stick was
ascertaining whether the cellar stretched out in front or behind
it was not in front then rang the bell and as hoped the
assistant answered it we have had some skirmishes but we had
never set eyes upon each other before hardly looked at his
face his knees were what wished to see you must yourself have
remarked how worn wrinkled and stained they were they spoke of
those hours of burrowing the only remaining point was what they
were burrowing for walked round the corner saw the city and
suburban bank abutted on our friends premises and felt that
had solved my problem when you drove home after the concert
called upon scotland yard and upon the chairman of the bank
directors with the result that you have seen

and how could you tell that they would make their attempt
tonight asked

well when they closed their league offices that was sign that
they cared no longer about mr jabez wilsons presencein other
words that they had completed their tunnel but it was essential
that they should use it soon as it might be discovered or the
bullion might be removed saturday would suit them better than
any other day as it would give them two days for their escape
for all these reasons expected them to come tonight

you reasoned it out beautifully exclaimed in unfeigned
admiration it is so long chain and yet every link rings
true

it saved me from ennui he answered yawning alas already
feel it closing in upon me my life is spent in one long effort
to escape from the commonplaces of existence these little
problems help me to do so

and you are benefactor of the race said

he shrugged his shoulders well perhaps after all it is of
some little use he remarked lhomme cest rienloeuvre
cest tout as gustave flaubert wrote to george sand



adventure iii case of identity

my dear fellow said sherlock holmes as we sat on either side
of the fire in his lodgings at baker street life is infinitely
stranger than anything which the mind of man could invent we
would not dare to conceive the things which are really mere
commonplaces of existence if we could fly out of that window
hand in hand hover over this great city gently remove the
roofs and peep in at the queer things which are going on the
strange coincidences the plannings the crosspurposes the
wonderful chains of events working through generations and
leading to the most results it would make all fiction with
its conventionalities and foreseen conclusions most stale and
unprofitable

and yet am not convinced of it answered the cases which
come to light in the papers are as rule bald enough and
vulgar enough we have in our police reports realism pushed to
its extreme limits and yet the result is it must be confessed
neither fascinating nor artistic

certain selection and discretion must be used in producing
realistic effect remarked holmes this is wanting in the
police report where more stress is laid perhaps upon the
platitudes of the magistrate than upon the details which to an
observer contain the vital essence of the whole matter depend
upon it there is nothing so unnatural as the commonplace

smiled and shook my head can quite understand your thinking
so said of course in your position of unofficial adviser
and helper to everybody who is absolutely puzzled throughout
three continents you are brought in contact with all that is
strange and bizarre but herei picked up the morning paper
from the groundlet us put it to practical test here is the
first heading upon which come husbands cruelty to his
wife there is half column of print but know without
reading it that it is all perfectly familiar to me there is of
course the other woman the drink the push the blow the
bruise the sympathetic sister or landlady the crudest of
writers could invent nothing more crude

indeed your example is an unfortunate one for your argument
said holmes taking the paper and glancing his eye down it this
is the dundas separation case and as it happens was engaged
in clearing up some small points in connection with it the
husband was teetotaler there was no other woman and the
conduct complained of was that he had drifted into the habit of
winding up every meal by taking out his false teeth and hurling
them at his wife which you will allow is not an action likely
to occur to the imagination of the average storyteller take
pinch of snuff doctor and acknowledge that have scored over
you in your example

he held out his snuffbox of old gold with great amethyst in
the centre of the lid its splendour was in such contrast to his
homely ways and simple life that could not help commenting upon
it

ah said he forgot that had not seen you for some weeks
it is little souvenir from the king of bohemia in return for my
assistance in the case of the irene adler papers

and the ring asked glancing at remarkable brilliant which
sparkled upon his finger

it was from the reigning family of holland though the matter in
which served them was of such delicacy that cannot confide it
even to you who have been good enough to chronicle one or two of
my little problems

and have you any on hand just now asked with interest

some ten or twelve but none which present any feature of
interest they are important you understand without being
interesting indeed have found that it is usually in
unimportant matters that there is field for the observation
and for the quick analysis of cause and effect which gives the
charm to an investigation the larger crimes are apt to be the
simpler for the bigger the crime the more obvious as rule is
the motive in these cases save for one rather intricate matter
which has been referred to me from marseilles there is nothing
which presents any features of interest it is possible however
that may have something better before very many minutes are
over for this is one of my clients or am much mistaken

he had risen from his chair and was standing between the parted
blinds gazing down into the dull neutraltinted london street
looking over his shoulder saw that on the pavement opposite
there stood large woman with heavy fur boa round her neck
and large curling red feather in broadbrimmed hat which was
tilted in coquettish duchess of devonshire fashion over her
ear from under this great panoply she peeped up in nervous
hesitating fashion at our windows while her body oscillated
backward and forward and her fingers fidgeted with her glove
buttons suddenly with plunge as of the swimmer who leaves
the bank she hurried across the road and we heard the sharp
clang of the bell

have seen those symptoms before said holmes throwing his
cigarette into the fire oscillation upon the pavement always
means an affaire de coeur she would like advice but is not sure
that the matter is not too delicate for communication and yet
even here we may discriminate when woman has been seriously
wronged by man she no longer oscillates and the usual symptom
is broken bell wire here we may take it that there is love
matter but that the maiden is not so much angry as perplexed or
grieved but here she comes in person to resolve our doubts

as he spoke there was tap at the door and the boy in buttons
entered to announce miss mary sutherland while the lady herself
loomed behind his small black figure like fullsailed
merchantman behind tiny pilot boat sherlock holmes welcomed
her with the easy courtesy for which he was remarkable and
having closed the door and bowed her into an armchair he looked
her over in the minute and yet abstracted fashion which was
peculiar to him

do you not find he said that with your short sight it is
little trying to do so much typewriting

did at first she answered but now know where the letters
are without looking then suddenly realising the full purport
of his words she gave violent start and looked up with fear
and astonishment upon her broad goodhumoured face youve
heard about me mr holmes she cried else how could you know
all that

never mind said holmes laughing it is my business to know
things perhaps have trained myself to see what others
overlook if not why should you come to consult me

came to you sir because heard of you from mrs etherege
whose husband you found so easy when the police and everyone had
given him up for dead oh mr holmes wish you would do as
much for me im not rich but still have hundred year in
my own right besides the little that make by the machine and
would give it all to know what has become of mr hosmer angel

why did you come away to consult me in such hurry asked
sherlock holmes with his fingertips together and his eyes to
the ceiling

again startled look came over the somewhat vacuous face of miss
mary sutherland yes did bang out of the house she said
for it made me angry to see the easy way in which mr
windibankthat is my fathertook it all he would not go to
the police and he would not go to you and so at last as he
would do nothing and kept on saying that there was no harm done
it made me mad and just on with my things and came right away
to you

your father said holmes your stepfather surely since the
name is different

yes my stepfather call him father though it sounds funny
too for he is only five years and two months older than myself

and your mother is alive

oh yes mother is alive and well wasnt best pleased mr
holmes when she married again so soon after fathers death and
man who was nearly fifteen years younger than herself father
was plumber in the tottenham court road and he left tidy
business behind him which mother carried on with mr hardy the
foreman but when mr windibank came he made her sell the
business for he was very superior being traveller in wines
they got pounds for the goodwill and interest which wasnt
near as much as father could have got if he had been alive

had expected to see sherlock holmes impatient under this
rambling and inconsequential narrative but on the contrary he
had listened with the greatest concentration of attention

your own little income he asked does it come out of the
business

oh no sir it is quite separate and was left me by my uncle
ned in auckland it is in new zealand stock paying per
cent two thousand five hundred pounds was the amount but can
only touch the interest

you interest me extremely said holmes and since you draw so
large sum as hundred year with what you earn into the
bargain you no doubt travel little and indulge yourself in
every way believe that single lady can get on very nicely
upon an income of about pounds

could do with much less than that mr holmes but you
understand that as long as live at home dont wish to be
burden to them and so they have the use of the money just while
am staying with them of course that is only just for the
time mr windibank draws my interest every quarter and pays it
over to mother and find that can do pretty well with what
earn at typewriting it brings me twopence sheet and can
often do from fifteen to twenty sheets in day

you have made your position very clear to me said holmes
this is my friend dr watson before whom you can speak as
freely as before myself kindly tell us now all about your
connection with mr hosmer angel

flush stole over miss sutherlands face and she picked
nervously at the fringe of her jacket met him first at the
gasfitters ball she said they used to send father tickets
when he was alive and then afterwards they remembered us and
sent them to mother mr windibank did not wish us to go he
never did wish us to go anywhere he would get quite mad if
wanted so much as to join sundayschool treat but this time
was set on going and would go for what right had he to
prevent he said the folk were not fit for us to know when all
fathers friends were to be there and he said that had nothing
fit to wear when had my purple plush that had never so much
as taken out of the drawer at last when nothing else would do
he went off to france upon the business of the firm but we went
mother and with mr hardy who used to be our foreman and it
was there met mr hosmer angel

suppose said holmes that when mr windibank came back from
france he was very annoyed at your having gone to the ball

oh well he was very good about it he laughed remember and
shrugged his shoulders and said there was no use denying
anything to woman for she would have her way

see then at the gasfitters ball you met as understand
gentleman called mr hosmer angel

yes sir met him that night and he called next day to ask if
we had got home all safe and after that we met himthat is to
say mr holmes met him twice for walks but after that father
came back again and mr hosmer angel could not come to the house
any more

no

well you know father didnt like anything of the sort he
wouldnt have any visitors if he could help it and he used to
say that woman should be happy in her own family circle but
then as used to say to mother woman wants her own circle to
begin with and had not got mine yet

but how about mr hosmer angel did he make no attempt to see
you

well father was going off to france again in week and hosmer
wrote and said that it would be safer and better not to see each
other until he had gone we could write in the meantime and he
used to write every day took the letters in in the morning so
there was no need for father to know

were you engaged to the gentleman at this time

oh yes mr holmes we were engaged after the first walk that
we took hosmermr angelwas cashier in an office in
leadenhall streetand

what office

thats the worst of it mr holmes dont know

where did he live then

he slept on the premises

and you dont know his address

noexcept that it was leadenhall street

where did you address your letters then

to the leadenhall street post office to be left till called
for he said that if they were sent to the office he would be
chaffed by all the other clerks about having letters from lady
so offered to typewrite them like he did his but he wouldnt
have that for he said that when wrote them they seemed to come
from me but when they were typewritten he always felt that the
machine had come between us that will just show you how fond he
was of me mr holmes and the little things that he would think
of

it was most suggestive said holmes it has long been an axiom
of mine that the little things are infinitely the most important
can you remember any other little things about mr hosmer angel

he was very shy man mr holmes he would rather walk with me
in the evening than in the daylight for he said that he hated to
be conspicuous very retiring and gentlemanly he was even his
voice was gentle hed had the quinsy and swollen glands when he
was young he told me and it had left him with weak throat
and hesitating whispering fashion of speech he was always
well dressed very neat and plain but his eyes were weak just
as mine are and he wore tinted glasses against the glare

well and what happened when mr windibank your stepfather
returned to france

mr hosmer angel came to the house again and proposed that we
should marry before father came back he was in dreadful earnest
and made me swear with my hands on the testament that whatever
happened would always be true to him mother said he was quite
right to make me swear and that it was sign of his passion
mother was all in his favour from the first and was even fonder
of him than was then when they talked of marrying within the
week began to ask about father but they both said never to
mind about father but just to tell him afterwards and mother
said she would make it all right with him didnt quite like
that mr holmes it seemed funny that should ask his leave as
he was only few years older than me but didnt want to do
anything on the sly so wrote to father at bordeaux where the
company has its french offices but the letter came back to me on
the very morning of the wedding

it missed him then

yes sir for he had started to england just before it arrived

ha that was unfortunate your wedding was arranged then for
the friday was it to be in church

yes sir but very quietly it was to be at st saviours near
kings cross and we were to have breakfast afterwards at the st
pancras hotel hosmer came for us in hansom but as there were
two of us he put us both into it and stepped himself into
fourwheeler which happened to be the only other cab in the
street we got to the church first and when the fourwheeler
drove up we waited for him to step out but he never did and
when the cabman got down from the box and looked there was no one
there the cabman said that he could not imagine what had become
of him for he had seen him get in with his own eyes that was
last friday mr holmes and have never seen or heard anything
since then to throw any light upon what became of him

it seems to me that you have been very shamefully treated said
holmes

oh no sir he was too good and kind to leave me so why all
the morning he was saying to me that whatever happened was to
be true and that even if something quite unforeseen occurred to
separate us was always to remember that was pledged to him
and that he would claim his pledge sooner or later it seemed
strange talk for weddingmorning but what has happened since
gives meaning to it

most certainly it does your own opinion is then that some
unforeseen catastrophe has occurred to him

yes sir believe that he foresaw some danger or else he
would not have talked so and then think that what he foresaw
happened

but you have no notion as to what it could have been

none

one more question how did your mother take the matter

she was angry and said that was never to speak of the matter
again

and your father did you tell him

yes and he seemed to think with me that something had
happened and that should hear of hosmer again as he said
what interest could anyone have in bringing me to the doors of
the church and then leaving me now if he had borrowed my
money or if he had married me and got my money settled on him
there might be some reason but hosmer was very independent about
money and never would look at shilling of mine and yet what
could have happened and why could he not write oh it drives me
halfmad to think of it and cant sleep wink at night she
pulled little handkerchief out of her muff and began to sob
heavily into it

shall glance into the case for you said holmes rising and
have no doubt that we shall reach some definite result let the
weight of the matter rest upon me now and do not let your mind
dwell upon it further above all try to let mr hosmer angel
vanish from your memory as he has done from your life

then you dont think ill see him again

fear not

then what has happened to him

you will leave that question in my hands should like an
accurate description of him and any letters of his which you can
spare

advertised for him in last saturdays chronicle said she
here is the slip and here are four letters from him

thank you and your address

no lyon place camberwell

mr angels address you never had understand where is your
fathers place of business

he travels for westhouse marbank the great claret importers
of fenchurch street

thank you you have made your statement very clearly you will
leave the papers here and remember the advice which have given
you let the whole incident be sealed book and do not allow it
to affect your life

you are very kind mr holmes but cannot do that shall be
true to hosmer he shall find me ready when he comes back

for all the preposterous hat and the vacuous face there was
something noble in the simple faith of our visitor which
compelled our respect she laid her little bundle of papers upon
the table and went her way with promise to come again whenever
she might be summoned

sherlock holmes sat silent for few minutes with his fingertips
still pressed together his legs stretched out in front of him
and his gaze directed upward to the ceiling then he took down
from the rack the old and oily clay pipe which was to him as
counsellor and having lit it he leaned back in his chair with
the thick blue cloudwreaths spinning up from him and look of
infinite languor in his face

quite an interesting study that maiden he observed found
her more interesting than her little problem which by the way
is rather trite one you will find parallel cases if you
consult my index in andover in and there was something of
the sort at the hague last year old as is the idea however
there were one or two details which were new to me but the
maiden herself was most instructive

you appeared to read good deal upon her which was quite
invisible to me remarked

not invisible but unnoticed watson you did not know where to
look and so you missed all that was important can never bring
you to realise the importance of sleeves the suggestiveness of
thumbnails or the great issues that may hang from bootlace
now what did you gather from that womans appearance describe
it

well she had slatecoloured broadbrimmed straw hat with
feather of brickish red her jacket was black with black beads
sewn upon it and fringe of little black jet ornaments her
dress was brown rather darker than coffee colour with little
purple plush at the neck and sleeves her gloves were greyish and
were worn through at the right forefinger her boots didnt
observe she had small round hanging gold earrings and
general air of being fairly welltodo in vulgar comfortable
easygoing way

sherlock holmes clapped his hands softly together and chuckled

pon my word watson you are coming along wonderfully you have
really done very well indeed it is true that you have missed
everything of importance but you have hit upon the method and
you have quick eye for colour never trust to general
impressions my boy but concentrate yourself upon details my
first glance is always at womans sleeve in man it is
perhaps better first to take the knee of the trouser as you
observe this woman had plush upon her sleeves which is most
useful material for showing traces the double line little
above the wrist where the typewritist presses against the table
was beautifully defined the sewingmachine of the hand type
leaves similar mark but only on the left arm and on the side
of it farthest from the thumb instead of being right across the
broadest part as this was then glanced at her face and
observing the dint of pincenez at either side of her nose
ventured remark upon short sight and typewriting which seemed
to surprise her

it surprised me

but surely it was obvious was then much surprised and
interested on glancing down to observe that though the boots
which she was wearing were not unlike each other they were
really odd ones the one having slightly decorated toecap and
the other plain one one was buttoned only in the two lower
buttons out of five and the other at the first third and
fifth now when you see that young lady otherwise neatly
dressed has come away from home with odd boots halfbuttoned
it is no great deduction to say that she came away in hurry

and what else asked keenly interested as always was by
my friends incisive reasoning

noted in passing that she had written note before leaving
home but after being fully dressed you observed that her right
glove was torn at the forefinger but you did not apparently see
that both glove and finger were stained with violet ink she had
written in hurry and dipped her pen too deep it must have been
this morning or the mark would not remain clear upon the finger
all this is amusing though rather elementary but must go back
to business watson would you mind reading me the advertised
description of mr hosmer angel

held the little printed slip to the light

missing it said on the morning of the fourteenth gentleman
named hosmer angel about five ft seven in in height
strongly built sallow complexion black hair little bald in
the centre bushy black sidewhiskers and moustache tinted
glasses slight infirmity of speech was dressed when last seen
in black frockcoat faced with silk black waistcoat gold albert
chain and grey harris tweed trousers with brown gaiters over
elasticsided boots known to have been employed in an office in
leadenhall street anybody bringing

that will do said holmes as to the letters he continued
glancing over them they are very commonplace absolutely no
clue in them to mr angel save that he quotes balzac once there
is one remarkable point however which will no doubt strike
you

they are typewritten remarked

not only that but the signature is typewritten look at the
neat little hosmer angel at the bottom there is date you
see but no superscription except leadenhall street which is
rather vague the point about the signature is very suggestivein
fact we may call it conclusive

of what

my dear fellow is it possible you do not see how strongly it
bears upon the case

cannot say that do unless it were that he wished to be able
to deny his signature if an action for breach of promise were
instituted

no that was not the point however shall write two letters
which should settle the matter one is to firm in the city the
other is to the young ladys stepfather mr windibank asking
him whether he could meet us here at six oclock tomorrow
evening it is just as well that we should do business with the
male relatives and now doctor we can do nothing until the
answers to those letters come so we may put our little problem
upon the shelf for the interim

had had so many reasons to believe in my friends subtle powers
of reasoning and extraordinary energy in action that felt that
he must have some solid grounds for the assured and easy
demeanour with which he treated the singular mystery which he had
been called upon to fathom once only had known him to fail in
the case of the king of bohemia and of the irene adler
photograph but when looked back to the weird business of the
sign of four and the extraordinary circumstances connected with
the study in scarlet felt that it would be strange tangle
indeed which he could not unravel

left him then still puffing at his black clay pipe with the
conviction that when came again on the next evening would
find that he held in his hands all the clues which would lead up
to the identity of the disappearing bridegroom of miss mary
sutherland

professional case of great gravity was engaging my own
attention at the time and the whole of next day was busy at
the bedside of the sufferer it was not until close upon six
oclock that found myself free and was able to spring into
hansom and drive to baker street half afraid that might be too
late to assist at the of the little mystery found
sherlock holmes alone however half asleep with his long thin
form curled up in the recesses of his armchair formidable
array of bottles and testtubes with the pungent cleanly smell
of hydrochloric acid told me that he had spent his day in the
chemical work which was so dear to him

well have you solved it asked as entered

yes it was the bisulphate of baryta

no no the mystery cried

oh that thought of the salt that have been working upon
there was never any mystery in the matter though as said
yesterday some of the details are of interest the only drawback
is that there is no law fear that can touch the scoundrel

who was he then and what was his object in deserting miss
sutherland

the question was hardly out of my mouth and holmes had not yet
opened his lips to reply when we heard heavy footfall in the
passage and tap at the door

this is the girls stepfather mr james windibank said
holmes he has written to me to say that he would be here at
six come in

the man who entered was sturdy middlesized fellow some
thirty years of age cleanshaven and sallowskinned with
bland insinuating manner and pair of wonderfully sharp and
penetrating grey eyes he shot questioning glance at each of
us placed his shiny tophat upon the sideboard and with
slight bow sidled down into the nearest chair

goodevening mr james windibank said holmes think that
this typewritten letter is from you in which you made an
appointment with me for six oclock

yes sir am afraid that am little late but am not
quite my own master you know am sorry that miss sutherland
has troubled you about this little matter for think it is far
better not to wash linen of the sort in public it was quite
against my wishes that she came but she is very excitable
impulsive girl as you may have noticed and she is not easily
controlled when she has made up her mind on point of course
did not mind you so much as you are not connected with the
official police but it is not pleasant to have family
misfortune like this noised abroad besides it is useless
expense for how could you possibly find this hosmer angel

on the contrary said holmes quietly have every reason to
believe that will succeed in discovering mr hosmer angel

mr windibank gave violent start and dropped his gloves am
delighted to hear it he said

it is curious thing remarked holmes that typewriter has
really quite as much individuality as mans handwriting unless
they are quite new no two of them write exactly alike some
letters get more worn than others and some wear only on one
side now you remark in this note of yours mr windibank that
in every case there is some little slurring over of the and
slight defect in the tail of the there are fourteen other
characteristics but those are the more obvious

we do all our correspondence with this machine at the office
and no doubt it is little worn our visitor answered glancing
keenly at holmes with his bright little eyes

and now will show you what is really very interesting study
mr windibank holmes continued think of writing another
little monograph some of these days on the typewriter and its
relation to crime it is subject to which have devoted some
little attention have here four letters which purport to come
from the missing man they are all typewritten in each case not
only are the es slurred and the rs tailless but you will
observe if you care to use my magnifying lens that the fourteen
other characteristics to which have alluded are there as well

mr windibank sprang out of his chair and picked up his hat
cannot waste time over this sort of fantastic talk mr holmes
he said if you can catch the man catch him and let me know
when you have done it

certainly said holmes stepping over and turning the key in
the door let you know then that have caught him

what where shouted mr windibank turning white to his lips
and glancing about him like rat in trap

oh it wont doreally it wont said holmes suavely there
is no possible getting out of it mr windibank it is quite too
transparent and it was very bad compliment when you said that
it was impossible for me to solve so simple question thats
right sit down and let us talk it over

our visitor collapsed into chair with ghastly face and
glitter of moisture on his brow itits not actionable he
stammered

am very much afraid that it is not but between ourselves
windibank it was as cruel and selfish and heartless trick in
petty way as ever came before me now let me just run over the
course of events and you will contradict me if go wrong

the man sat huddled up in his chair with his head sunk upon his
breast like one who is utterly crushed holmes stuck his feet up
on the corner of the mantelpiece and leaning back with his hands
in his pockets began talking rather to himself as it seemed
than to us

the man married woman very much older than himself for her
money said he and he enjoyed the use of the money of the
daughter as long as she lived with them it was considerable
sum for people in their position and the loss of it would have
made serious difference it was worth an effort to preserve it
the daughter was of good amiable disposition but affectionate
and warmhearted in her ways so that it was evident that with
her fair personal advantages and her little income she would
not be allowed to remain single long now her marriage would
mean of course the loss of hundred year so what does her
stepfather do to prevent it he takes the obvious course of
keeping her at home and forbidding her to seek the company of
people of her own age but soon he found that that would not
answer forever she became restive insisted upon her rights and
finally announced her positive intention of going to certain
ball what does her clever stepfather do then he conceives an
idea more creditable to his head than to his heart with the
connivance and assistance of his wife he disguised himself
covered those keen eyes with tinted glasses masked the face with
moustache and pair of bushy whiskers sunk that clear voice
into an insinuating whisper and doubly secure on account of the
girls short sight he appears as mr hosmer angel and keeps off
other lovers by making love himself

it was only joke at first groaned our visitor we never
thought that she would have been so carried away

very likely not however that may be the young lady was very
decidedly carried away and having quite made up her mind that
her stepfather was in france the suspicion of treachery never
for an instant entered her mind she was flattered by the
gentlemans attentions and the effect was increased by the
loudly expressed admiration of her mother then mr angel began
to call for it was obvious that the matter should be pushed as
far as it would go if real effect were to be produced there
were meetings and an engagement which would finally secure the
girls affections from turning towards anyone else but the
deception could not be kept up forever these pretended journeys
to france were rather cumbrous the thing to do was clearly to
bring the business to an end in such dramatic manner that it
would leave permanent impression upon the young ladys mind and
prevent her from looking upon any other suitor for some time to
come hence those vows of fidelity exacted upon testament and
hence also the allusions to possibility of something happening
on the very morning of the wedding james windibank wished miss
sutherland to be so bound to hosmer angel and so uncertain as to
his fate that for ten years to come at any rate she would not
listen to another man as far as the church door he brought her
and then as he could go no farther he conveniently vanished
away by the old trick of stepping in at one door of
fourwheeler and out at the other think that was the chain of
events mr windibank

our visitor had recovered something of his assurance while holmes
had been talking and he rose from his chair now with cold
sneer upon his pale face

it may be so or it may not mr holmes said he but if you
are so very sharp you ought to be sharp enough to know that it is
you who are breaking the law now and not me have done nothing
actionable from the first but as long as you keep that door
locked you lay yourself open to an action for assault and illegal
constraint

the law cannot as you say touch you said holmes unlocking
and throwing open the door yet there never was man who
deserved punishment more if the young lady has brother or
friend he ought to lay whip across your shoulders by jove
he continued flushing up at the sight of the bitter sneer upon
the mans face it is not part of my duties to my client but
heres hunting crop handy and think shall just treat
myself to he took two swift steps to the whip but before he
could grasp it there was wild clatter of steps upon the stairs
the heavy hall door banged and from the window we could see mr
james windibank running at the top of his speed down the road

theres coldblooded scoundrel said holmes laughing as he
threw himself down into his chair once more that fellow will
rise from crime to crime until he does something very bad and
ends on gallows the case has in some respects been not
entirely devoid of interest

cannot now entirely see all the steps of your reasoning
remarked

well of course it was obvious from the first that this mr
hosmer angel must have some strong object for his curious
conduct and it was equally clear that the only man who really
profited by the incident as far as we could see was the
stepfather then the fact that the two men were never together
but that the one always appeared when the other was away was
suggestive so were the tinted spectacles and the curious voice
which both hinted at disguise as did the bushy whiskers my
suspicions were all confirmed by his peculiar action in
typewriting his signature which of course inferred that his
handwriting was so familiar to her that she would recognise even
the smallest sample of it you see all these isolated facts
together with many minor ones all pointed in the same
direction

and how did you verify them

having once spotted my man it was easy to get corroboration
knew the firm for which this man worked having taken the printed
description eliminated everything from it which could be the
result of disguisethe whiskers the glasses the voice and
sent it to the firm with request that they would inform me
whether it answered to the description of any of their
travellers had already noticed the peculiarities of the
typewriter and wrote to the man himself at his business
address asking him if he would come here as expected his
reply was typewritten and revealed the same trivial but
characteristic defects the same post brought me letter from
westhouse marbank of fenchurch street to say that the
description tallied in every respect with that of their
james windibank tout

and miss sutherland

if tell her she will not believe me you may remember the old
persian saying there is danger for him who taketh the tiger
cub and danger also for whoso snatches delusion from woman
there is as much sense in hafiz as in horace and as much
knowledge of the world



adventure iv the boscombe valley mystery

we were seated at breakfast one morning my wife and when the
maid brought in telegram it was from sherlock holmes and ran
in this way

have you couple of days to spare have just been wired for from
the west of england in connection with boscombe valley tragedy
shall be glad if you will come with me air and scenery perfect
leave paddington by the

what do you say dear said my wife looking across at me
will you go

really dont know what to say have fairly long list at
present

oh anstruther would do your work for you you have been looking
little pale lately think that the change would do you good
and you are always so interested in mr sherlock holmes cases

should be ungrateful if were not seeing what gained
through one of them answered but if am to go must pack
at once for have only half an hour

my experience of camp life in afghanistan had at least had the
effect of making me prompt and ready traveller my wants were
few and simple so that in less than the time stated was in
cab with my valise rattling away to paddington station sherlock
holmes was pacing up and down the platform his tall gaunt
figure made even gaunter and taller by his long grey
travellingcloak and closefitting cloth cap

it is really very good of you to come watson said he it
makes considerable difference to me having someone with me on
whom can thoroughly rely local aid is always either worthless
or else biassed if you will keep the two corner seats shall
get the tickets

we had the carriage to ourselves save for an immense litter of
papers which holmes had brought with him among these he rummaged
and read with intervals of notetaking and of meditation until
we were past reading then he suddenly rolled them all into
gigantic ball and tossed them up onto the rack

have you heard anything of the case he asked

not word have not seen paper for some days

the london press has not had very full accounts have just
been looking through all the recent papers in order to master the
particulars it seems from what gather to be one of those
simple cases which are so extremely difficult

that sounds little paradoxical

but it is profoundly true singularity is almost invariably
clue the more featureless and commonplace crime is the more
difficult it is to bring it home in this case however they
have established very serious case against the son of the
murdered man

it is murder then

well it is conjectured to be so shall take nothing for
granted until have the opportunity of looking personally into
it will explain the state of things to you as far as have
been able to understand it in very few words

boscombe valley is country district not very far from ross in
herefordshire the largest landed proprietor in that part is
mr john turner who made his money in australia and returned
some years ago to the old country one of the farms which he
held that of hatherley was let to mr charles mccarthy who was
also an exaustralian the men had known each other in the
colonies so that it was not unnatural that when they came to
settle down they should do so as near each other as possible
turner was apparently the richer man so mccarthy became his
tenant but still remained it seems upon terms of perfect
equality as they were frequently together mccarthy had one son
lad of eighteen and turner had an only daughter of the same
age but neither of them had wives living they appear to have
avoided the society of the neighbouring english families and to
have led retired lives though both the mccarthys were fond of
sport and were frequently seen at the racemeetings of the
neighbourhood mccarthy kept two servantsa man and girl
turner had considerable household some halfdozen at the
least that is as much as have been able to gather about the
families now for the facts

on june that is on monday last mccarthy left his house at
hatherley about three in the afternoon and walked down to the
boscombe pool which is small lake formed by the spreading out
of the stream which runs down the boscombe valley he had been
out with his servingman in the morning at ross and he had told
the man that he must hurry as he had an appointment of
importance to keep at three from that appointment he never came
back alive

from hatherley farmhouse to the boscombe pool is quarter of
mile and two people saw him as he passed over this ground one
was an old woman whose name is not mentioned and the other was
william crowder gamekeeper in the employ of mr turner both
these witnesses depose that mr mccarthy was walking alone the
gamekeeper adds that within few minutes of his seeing mr
mccarthy pass he had seen his son mr james mccarthy going the
same way with gun under his arm to the best of his belief the
father was actually in sight at the time and the son was
following him he thought no more of the matter until he heard in
the evening of the tragedy that had occurred

the two mccarthys were seen after the time when william crowder
the gamekeeper lost sight of them the boscombe pool is thickly
wooded round with just fringe of grass and of reeds round the
edge girl of fourteen patience moran who is the daughter of
the lodgekeeper of the boscombe valley estate was in one of the
woods picking flowers she states that while she was there she
saw at the border of the wood and close by the lake mr
mccarthy and his son and that they appeared to be having
violent quarrel she heard mr mccarthy the elder using very
strong language to his son and she saw the latter raise up his
hand as if to strike his father she was so frightened by their
violence that she ran away and told her mother when she reached
home that she had left the two mccarthys quarrelling near
boscombe pool and that she was afraid that they were going to
fight she had hardly said the words when young mr mccarthy came
running up to the lodge to say that he had found his father dead
in the wood and to ask for the help of the lodgekeeper he was
much excited without either his gun or his hat and his right
hand and sleeve were observed to be stained with fresh blood on
following him they found the dead body stretched out upon the
grass beside the pool the head had been beaten in by repeated
blows of some heavy and blunt weapon the injuries were such as
might very well have been inflicted by the buttend of his sons
gun which was found lying on the grass within few paces of the
body under these circumstances the young man was instantly
arrested and verdict of wilful murder having been returned
at the inquest on tuesday he was on wednesday brought before the
magistrates at ross who have referred the case to the next
assizes those are the main facts of the case as they came out
before the coroner and the policecourt

could hardly imagine more damning case remarked if
ever circumstantial evidence pointed to criminal it does so
here

circumstantial evidence is very tricky thing answered holmes
thoughtfully it may seem to point very straight to one thing
but if you shift your own point of view little you may find it
pointing in an equally uncompromising manner to something
entirely different it must be confessed however that the case
looks exceedingly grave against the young man and it is very
possible that he is indeed the culprit there are several people
in the neighbourhood however and among them miss turner the
daughter of the neighbouring landowner who believe in his
innocence and who have retained lestrade whom you may recollect
in connection with the study in scarlet to work out the case in
his interest lestrade being rather puzzled has referred the
case to me and hence it is that two middleaged gentlemen are
flying westward at fifty miles an hour instead of quietly
digesting their breakfasts at home

am afraid said that the facts are so obvious that you
will find little credit to be gained out of this case

there is nothing more deceptive than an obvious fact he
answered laughing besides we may chance to hit upon some
other obvious facts which may have been by no means obvious to
mr lestrade you know me too well to think that am boasting
when say that shall either confirm or destroy his theory by
means which he is quite incapable of employing or even of
understanding to take the first example to hand very clearly
perceive that in your bedroom the window is upon the righthand
side and yet question whether mr lestrade would have noted
even so selfevident thing as that

how on earth

my dear fellow know you well know the military neatness
which characterises you you shave every morning and in this
season you shave by the sunlight but since your shaving is less
and less complete as we get farther back on the left side until
it becomes positively slovenly as we get round the angle of the
jaw it is surely very clear that that side is less illuminated
than the other could not imagine man of your habits looking
at himself in an equal light and being satisfied with such
result only quote this as trivial example of observation and
inference therein lies my and it is just possible that
it may be of some service in the investigation which lies before
us there are one or two minor points which were brought out in
the inquest and which are worth considering

what are they

it appears that his arrest did not take place at once but after
the return to hatherley farm on the inspector of constabulary
informing him that he was prisoner he remarked that he was not
surprised to hear it and that it was no more than his deserts
this observation of his had the natural effect of removing any
traces of doubt which might have remained in the minds of the
coroners jury

it was confession ejaculated

no for it was followed by protestation of innocence

coming on the top of such damning series of events it was at
least most suspicious remark

on the contrary said holmes it is the brightest rift which
can at present see in the clouds however innocent he might be
he could not be such an absolute imbecile as not to see that the
circumstances were very black against him had he appeared
surprised at his own arrest or feigned indignation at it
should have looked upon it as highly suspicious because such
surprise or anger would not be natural under the circumstances
and yet might appear to be the best policy to scheming man his
frank acceptance of the situation marks him as either an innocent
man or else as man of considerable selfrestraint and
firmness as to his remark about his deserts it was also not
unnatural if you consider that he stood beside the dead body of
his father and that there is no doubt that he had that very day
so far forgotten his filial duty as to bandy words with him and
even according to the little girl whose evidence is so
important to raise his hand as if to strike him the
selfreproach and contrition which are displayed in his remark
appear to me to be the signs of healthy mind rather than of
guilty one

shook my head many men have been hanged on far slighter
evidence remarked

so they have and many men have been wrongfully hanged

what is the young mans own account of the matter

it is am afraid not very encouraging to his supporters
though there are one or two points in it which are suggestive
you will find it here and may read it for yourself

he picked out from his bundle copy of the local herefordshire
paper and having turned down the sheet he pointed out the
paragraph in which the unfortunate young man had given his own
statement of what had occurred settled myself down in the
corner of the carriage and read it very carefully it ran in this
way

mr james mccarthy the only son of the deceased was then called
and gave evidence as follows had been away from home for
three days at bristol and had only just returned upon the
morning of last monday the my father was absent from home at
the time of my arrival and was informed by the maid that he
had driven over to ross with john cobb the groom shortly after
my return heard the wheels of his trap in the yard and
looking out of my window saw him get out and walk rapidly out
of the yard though was not aware in which direction he was
going then took my gun and strolled out in the direction of
the boscombe pool with the intention of visiting the rabbit
warren which is upon the other side on my way saw william
crowder the gamekeeper as he had stated in his evidence but
he is mistaken in thinking that was following my father had
no idea that he was in front of me when about hundred yards
from the pool heard cry of cooee which was usual signal
between my father and myself then hurried forward and found
him standing by the pool he appeared to be much surprised at
seeing me and asked me rather roughly what was doing there
conversation ensued which led to high words and almost to blows
for my father was man of very violent temper seeing that his
passion was becoming ungovernable left him and returned
towards hatherley farm had not gone more than yards
however when heard hideous outcry behind me which caused me
to run back again found my father expiring upon the ground
with his head terribly injured dropped my gun and held him in
my arms but he almost instantly expired knelt beside him for
some minutes and then made my way to mr turners lodgekeeper
his house being the nearest to ask for assistance saw no one
near my father when returned and have no idea how he came by
his injuries he was not popular man being somewhat cold and
forbidding in his manners but he had as far as know no
active enemies know nothing further of the matter

the coroner did your father make any statement to you before
he died

witness he mumbled few words but could only catch some
allusion to rat

the coroner what did you understand by that

witness it conveyed no meaning to me thought that he was
delirious

the coroner what was the point upon which you and your father
had this final quarrel

witness should prefer not to answer

the coroner am afraid that must press it

witness it is really impossible for me to tell you can
assure you that it has nothing to do with the sad tragedy which
followed

the coroner that is for the court to decide need not point
out to you that your refusal to answer will prejudice your case
considerably in any future proceedings which may arise

witness must still refuse

the coroner understand that the cry of cooee was common
signal between you and your father

witness it was

the coroner how was it then that he uttered it before he saw
you and before he even knew that you had returned from bristol

witness with considerable confusion do not know

juryman did you see nothing which aroused your suspicions
when you returned on hearing the cry and found your father
fatally injured

witness nothing definite

the coroner what do you mean

witness was so disturbed and excited as rushed out into
the open that could think of nothing except of my father yet
have vague impression that as ran forward something lay
upon the ground to the left of me it seemed to me to be
something grey in colour coat of some sort or plaid perhaps
when rose from my father looked round for it but it was
gone

do you mean that it disappeared before you went for help

yes it was gone

you cannot say what it was

no had feeling something was there

how far from the body

dozen yards or so

and how far from the edge of the wood

about the same

then if it was removed it was while you were within dozen
yards of it

yes but with my back towards it

this concluded the examination of the witness

see said as glanced down the column that the coroner
in his concluding remarks was rather severe upon young mccarthy
he calls attention and with reason to the discrepancy about his
father having signalled to him before seeing him also to his
refusal to give details of his conversation with his father and
his singular account of his fathers dying words they are all
as he remarks very much against the son

holmes laughed softly to himself and stretched himself out upon
the cushioned seat both you and the coroner have been at some
pains said he to single out the very strongest points in the
young mans favour dont you see that you alternately give him
credit for having too much imagination and too little too
little if he could not invent cause of quarrel which would
give him the sympathy of the jury too much if he evolved from
his own inner consciousness anything so as dying
reference to rat and the incident of the vanishing cloth no
sir shall approach this case from the point of view that what
this young man says is true and we shall see whither that
hypothesis will lead us and now here is my pocket petrarch and
not another word shall say of this case until we are on the
scene of action we lunch at swindon and see that we shall be
there in twenty minutes

it was nearly four oclock when we at last after passing through
the beautiful stroud valley and over the broad gleaming severn
found ourselves at the pretty little countrytown of ross
lean ferretlike man furtive and slylooking was waiting for
us upon the platform in spite of the light brown dustcoat and
leatherleggings which he wore in deference to his rustic
surroundings had no difficulty in recognising lestrade of
scotland yard with him we drove to the hereford arms where
room had already been engaged for us

have ordered carriage said lestrade as we sat over cup
of tea knew your energetic nature and that you would not be
happy until you had been on the scene of the crime

it was very nice and complimentary of you holmes answered it
is entirely question of barometric pressure

lestrade looked startled do not quite follow he said

how is the glass twentynine see no wind and not cloud
in the sky have caseful of cigarettes here which need
smoking and the sofa is very much superior to the usual country
hotel abomination do not think that it is probable that
shall use the carriage tonight

lestrade laughed indulgently you have no doubt already formed
your conclusions from the newspapers he said the case is as
plain as pikestaff and the more one goes into it the plainer
it becomes still of course one cant refuse lady and such
very positive one too she has heard of you and would have your
opinion though repeatedly told her that there was nothing
which you could do which had not already done why bless my
soul here is her carriage at the door

he had hardly spoken before there rushed into the room one of the
most lovely young women that have ever seen in my life her
violet eyes shining her lips parted pink flush upon her
cheeks all thought of her natural reserve lost in her
overpowering excitement and concern

oh mr sherlock holmes she cried glancing from one to the
other of us and finally with womans quick intuition
fastening upon my companion am so glad that you have come
have driven down to tell you so know that james didnt do it
know it and want you to start upon your work knowing it
too never let yourself doubt upon that point we have known each
other since we were little children and know his faults as no
one else does but he is too tenderhearted to hurt fly such
charge is absurd to anyone who really knows him

hope we may clear him miss turner said sherlock holmes
you may rely upon my doing all that can

but you have read the evidence you have formed some conclusion
do you not see some loophole some flaw do you not yourself
think that he is innocent

think that it is very probable

there now she cried throwing back her head and looking
defiantly at lestrade you hear he gives me hopes

lestrade shrugged his shoulders am afraid that my colleague
has been little quick in forming his conclusions he said

but he is right oh know that he is right james never did
it and about his quarrel with his father am sure that the
reason why he would not speak about it to the coroner was because
was concerned in it

in what way asked holmes

it is no time for me to hide anything james and his father had
many disagreements about me mr mccarthy was very anxious that
there should be marriage between us james and have always
loved each other as brother and sister but of course he is young
and has seen very little of life yet andandwell he
naturally did not wish to do anything like that yet so there
were quarrels and this am sure was one of them

and your father asked holmes was he in favour of such
union

no he was averse to it also no one but mr mccarthy was in
favour of it quick blush passed over her fresh young face as
holmes shot one of his keen questioning glances at her

thank you for this information said he may see your father
if call tomorrow

am afraid the doctor wont allow it

the doctor

yes have you not heard poor father has never been strong for
years back but this has broken him down completely he has taken
to his bed and dr willows says that he is wreck and that his
nervous system is shattered mr mccarthy was the only man alive
who had known dad in the old days in victoria

ha in victoria that is important

yes at the mines

quite so at the goldmines where as understand mr turner
made his money

yes certainly

thank you miss turner you have been of material assistance to
me

you will tell me if you have any news tomorrow no doubt you
will go to the prison to see james oh if you do mr holmes do
tell him that know him to be innocent

will miss turner

must go home now for dad is very ill and he misses me so if
leave him goodbye and god help you in your undertaking she
hurried from the room as impulsively as she had entered and we
heard the wheels of her carriage rattle off down the street

am ashamed of you holmes said lestrade with dignity after
few minutes silence why should you raise up hopes which you
are bound to disappoint am not overtender of heart but
call it cruel

think that see my way to clearing james mccarthy said
holmes have you an order to see him in prison

yes but only for you and me

then shall reconsider my resolution about going out we have
still time to take train to hereford and see him tonight

ample

then let us do so watson fear that you will find it very
slow but shall only be away couple of hours

walked down to the station with them and then wandered through
the streets of the little town finally returning to the hotel
where lay upon the sofa and tried to interest myself in
yellowbacked novel the puny plot of the story was so thin
however when compared to the deep mystery through which we were
groping and found my attention wander so continually from the
action to the fact that at last flung it across the room and
gave myself up entirely to consideration of the events of the
day supposing that this unhappy young mans story were
absolutely true then what hellish thing what absolutely
unforeseen and extraordinary calamity could have occurred between
the time when he parted from his father and the moment when
drawn back by his screams he rushed into the glade it was
something terrible and deadly what could it be might not the
nature of the injuries reveal something to my medical instincts
rang the bell and called for the weekly county paper which
contained verbatim account of the inquest in the surgeons
deposition it was stated that the posterior third of the left
parietal bone and the left half of the occipital bone had been
shattered by heavy blow from blunt weapon marked the spot
upon my own head clearly such blow must have been struck from
behind that was to some extent in favour of the accused as when
seen quarrelling he was face to face with his father still it
did not go for very much for the older man might have turned his
back before the blow fell still it might be worth while to call
holmes attention to it then there was the peculiar dying
reference to rat what could that mean it could not be
delirium man dying from sudden blow does not commonly become
delirious no it was more likely to be an attempt to explain how
he met his fate but what could it indicate cudgelled my
brains to find some possible explanation and then the incident
of the grey cloth seen by young mccarthy if that were true the
murderer must have dropped some part of his dress presumably his
overcoat in his flight and must have had the hardihood to
return and to carry it away at the instant when the son was
kneeling with his back turned not dozen paces off what
tissue of mysteries and improbabilities the whole thing was
did not wonder at lestrades opinion and yet had so much faith
in sherlock holmes insight that could not lose hope as long
as every fresh fact seemed to strengthen his conviction of young
mccarthys innocence

it was late before sherlock holmes returned he came back alone
for lestrade was staying in lodgings in the town

the glass still keeps very high he remarked as he sat down
it is of importance that it should not rain before we are able
to go over the ground on the other hand man should be at his
very best and keenest for such nice work as that and did not
wish to do it when fagged by long journey have seen young
mccarthy

and what did you learn from him

nothing

could he throw no light

none at all was inclined to think at one time that he knew
who had done it and was screening him or her but am convinced
now that he is as puzzled as everyone else he is not very
quickwitted youth though comely to look at and should think
sound at heart

cannot admire his taste remarked if it is indeed fact
that he was averse to marriage with so charming young lady as
this miss turner

ah thereby hangs rather painful tale this fellow is madly
insanely in love with her but some two years ago when he was
only lad and before he really knew her for she had been away
five years at boardingschool what does the idiot do but get
into the clutches of barmaid in bristol and marry her at
registry office no one knows word of the matter but you can
imagine how maddening it must be to him to be upbraided for not
doing what he would give his very eyes to do but what he knows
to be absolutely impossible it was sheer frenzy of this sort
which made him throw his hands up into the air when his father
at their last interview was goading him on to propose to miss
turner on the other hand he had no means of supporting himself
and his father who was by all accounts very hard man would
have thrown him over utterly had he known the truth it was with
his barmaid wife that he had spent the last three days in
bristol and his father did not know where he was mark that
point it is of importance good has come out of evil however
for the barmaid finding from the papers that he is in serious
trouble and likely to be hanged has thrown him over utterly and
has written to him to say that she has husband already in the
bermuda dockyard so that there is really no tie between them
think that that bit of news has consoled young mccarthy for all
that he has suffered

but if he is innocent who has done it

ah who would call your attention very particularly to two
points one is that the murdered man had an appointment with
someone at the pool and that the someone could not have been his
son for his son was away and he did not know when he would
return the second is that the murdered man was heard to cry
cooee before he knew that his son had returned those are the
crucial points upon which the case depends and now let us talk
about george meredith if you please and we shall leave all
minor matters until tomorrow

there was no rain as holmes had foretold and the morning broke
bright and cloudless at nine oclock lestrade called for us with
the carriage and we set off for hatherley farm and the boscombe
pool

there is serious news this morning lestrade observed it is
said that mr turner of the hall is so ill that his life is
despaired of

an elderly man presume said holmes

about sixty but his constitution has been shattered by his life
abroad and he has been in failing health for some time this
business has had very bad effect upon him he was an old friend
of mccarthys and may add great benefactor to him for
have learned that he gave him hatherley farm rent free

indeed that is interesting said holmes

oh yes in hundred other ways he has helped him everybody
about here speaks of his kindness to him

really does it not strike you as little singular that this
mccarthy who appears to have had little of his own and to have
been under such obligations to turner should still talk of
marrying his son to turners daughter who is presumably
heiress to the estate and that in such very cocksure manner
as if it were merely case of proposal and all else would
follow it is the more strange since we know that turner himself
was averse to the idea the daughter told us as much do you not
deduce something from that

we have got to the deductions and the inferences said
lestrade winking at me find it hard enough to tackle facts
holmes without flying away after theories and fancies

you are right said holmes demurely you do find it very hard
to tackle the facts

anyhow have grasped one fact which you seem to find it
difficult to get hold of replied lestrade with some warmth

and that is

that mccarthy senior met his death from mccarthy junior and that
all theories to the contrary are the merest moonshine

well moonshine is brighter thing than fog said holmes
laughing but am very much mistaken if this is not hatherley
farm upon the left

yes that is it it was widespread comfortablelooking
building twostoried slateroofed with great yellow blotches
of lichen upon the grey walls the drawn blinds and the smokeless
chimneys however gave it stricken look as though the weight
of this horror still lay heavy upon it we called at the door
when the maid at holmes request showed us the boots which her
master wore at the time of his death and also pair of the
sons though not the pair which he had then had having measured
these very carefully from seven or eight different points holmes
desired to be led to the courtyard from which we all followed
the winding track which led to boscombe pool

sherlock holmes was transformed when he was hot upon such scent
as this men who had only known the quiet thinker and logician of
baker street would have failed to recognise him his face flushed
and darkened his brows were drawn into two hard black lines
while his eyes shone out from beneath them with steely glitter
his face was bent downward his shoulders bowed his lips
compressed and the veins stood out like whipcord in his long
sinewy neck his nostrils seemed to dilate with purely animal
lust for the chase and his mind was so absolutely concentrated
upon the matter before him that question or remark fell
unheeded upon his ears or at the most only provoked quick
impatient snarl in reply swiftly and silently he made his way
along the track which ran through the meadows and so by way of
the woods to the boscombe pool it was damp marshy ground as is
all that district and there were marks of many feet both upon
the path and amid the short grass which bounded it on either
side sometimes holmes would hurry on sometimes stop dead and
once he made quite little detour into the meadow lestrade and
walked behind him the detective indifferent and contemptuous
while watched my friend with the interest which sprang from the
conviction that every one of his actions was directed towards
definite end

the boscombe pool which is little reedgirt sheet of water
some fifty yards across is situated at the boundary between the
hatherley farm and the private park of the wealthy mr turner
above the woods which lined it upon the farther side we could see
the red jutting pinnacles which marked the site of the rich
landowners dwelling on the hatherley side of the pool the woods
grew very thick and there was narrow belt of sodden grass
twenty paces across between the edge of the trees and the reeds
which lined the lake lestrade showed us the exact spot at which
the body had been found and indeed so moist was the ground
that could plainly see the traces which had been left by the
fall of the stricken man to holmes as could see by his eager
face and peering eyes very many other things were to be read
upon the trampled grass he ran round like dog who is picking
up scent and then turned upon my companion

what did you go into the pool for he asked

fished about with rake thought there might be some weapon
or other trace but how on earth

oh tut tut have no time that left foot of yours with its
inward twist is all over the place mole could trace it and
there it vanishes among the reeds oh how simple it would all
have been had been here before they came like herd of buffalo
and wallowed all over it here is where the party with the
lodgekeeper came and they have covered all tracks for six or
eight feet round the body but here are three separate tracks of
the same feet he drew out lens and lay down upon his
waterproof to have better view talking all the time rather to
himself than to us these are young mccarthys feet twice he
was walking and once he ran swiftly so that the soles are
deeply marked and the heels hardly visible that bears out his
story he ran when he saw his father on the ground then here are
the fathers feet as he paced up and down what is this then it
is the buttend of the gun as the son stood listening and this
ha ha what have we here tiptoes tiptoes square too quite
unusual boots they come they go they come againof course
that was for the cloak now where did they come from he ran up
and down sometimes losing sometimes finding the track until we
were well within the edge of the wood and under the shadow of
great beech the largest tree in the neighbourhood holmes traced
his way to the farther side of this and lay down once more upon
his face with little cry of satisfaction for long time he
remained there turning over the leaves and dried sticks
gathering up what seemed to me to be dust into an envelope and
examining with his lens not only the ground but even the bark of
the tree as far as he could reach jagged stone was lying among
the moss and this also he carefully examined and retained then
he followed pathway through the wood until he came to the
highroad where all traces were lost

it has been case of considerable interest he remarked
returning to his natural manner fancy that this grey house on
the right must be the lodge think that will go in and have
word with moran and perhaps write little note having done
that we may drive back to our luncheon you may walk to the cab
and shall be with you presently

it was about ten minutes before we regained our cab and drove
back into ross holmes still carrying with him the stone which he
had picked up in the wood

this may interest you lestrade he remarked holding it out
the murder was done with it

see no marks

there are none

how do you know then

the grass was growing under it it had only lain there few
days there was no sign of place whence it had been taken it
corresponds with the injuries there is no sign of any other
weapon

and the murderer

is tall man lefthanded limps with the right leg wears
thicksoled shootingboots and grey cloak smokes indian
cigars uses cigarholder and carries blunt penknife in his
pocket there are several other indications but these may be
enough to aid us in our search

lestrade laughed am afraid that am still sceptic he
said theories are all very well but we have to deal with
hardheaded british jury

nous verrons answered holmes calmly you work your own
method and shall work mine shall be busy this afternoon
and shall probably return to london by the evening train

and leave your case unfinished

no finished

but the mystery

it is solved

who was the criminal then

the gentleman describe

but who is he

surely it would not be difficult to find out this is not such
populous neighbourhood

lestrade shrugged his shoulders am practical man he said
and really cannot undertake to go about the country looking
for lefthanded gentleman with game leg should become the
laughingstock of scotland yard

all right said holmes quietly have given you the chance
here are your lodgings goodbye shall drop you line before
leave

having left lestrade at his rooms we drove to our hotel where
we found lunch upon the table holmes was silent and buried in
thought with pained expression upon his face as one who finds
himself in perplexing position

look here watson he said when the cloth was cleared just sit
down in this chair and let me preach to you for little dont
know quite what to do and should value your advice light
cigar and let me expound

pray do so

well now in considering this case there are two points about
young mccarthys narrative which struck us both instantly
although they impressed me in his favour and you against him one
was the fact that his father should according to his account
cry cooee before seeing him the other was his singular dying
reference to rat he mumbled several words you understand but
that was all that caught the sons ear now from this double
point our research must commence and we will begin it by
presuming that what the lad says is absolutely true

what of this cooee then

well obviously it could not have been meant for the son the
son as far as he knew was in bristol it was mere chance that
he was within earshot the cooee was meant to attract the
attention of whoever it was that he had the appointment with but
cooee is distinctly australian cry and one which is used
between australians there is strong presumption that the
person whom mccarthy expected to meet him at boscombe pool was
someone who had been in australia

what of the rat then

sherlock holmes took folded paper from his pocket and flattened
it out on the table this is map of the colony of victoria
he said wired to bristol for it last night he put his hand
over part of the map what do you read

arat read

and now he raised his hand

ballarat

quite so that was the word the man uttered and of which his
son only caught the last two syllables he was trying to utter
the name of his murderer so and so of ballarat

it is wonderful exclaimed

it is obvious and now you see had narrowed the field down
considerably the possession of grey garment was third point
which granting the sons statement to be correct was
certainty we have come now out of mere vagueness to the definite
conception of an australian from ballarat with grey cloak

certainly

and one who was at home in the district for the pool can only
be approached by the farm or by the estate where strangers could
hardly wander

quite so

then comes our expedition of today by an examination of the
ground gained the trifling details which gave to that
imbecile lestrade as to the personality of the criminal

but how did you gain them

you know my method it is founded upon the observation of
trifles

his height know that you might roughly judge from the length
of his stride his boots too might be told from their traces

yes they were peculiar boots

but his lameness

the impression of his right foot was always less distinct than
his left he put less weight upon it why because he limpedhe
was lame

but his lefthandedness

you were yourself struck by the nature of the injury as recorded
by the surgeon at the inquest the blow was struck from
immediately behind and yet was upon the left side now how can
that be unless it were by lefthanded man he had stood behind
that tree during the interview between the father and son he had
even smoked there found the ash of cigar which my special
knowledge of tobacco ashes enables me to pronounce as an indian
cigar have as you know devoted some attention to this and
written little monograph on the ashes of different
varieties of pipe cigar and cigarette tobacco having found the
ash then looked round and discovered the stump among the moss
where he had tossed it it was an indian cigar of the variety
which are rolled in rotterdam

and the cigarholder

could see that the end had not been in his mouth therefore he
used holder the tip had been cut off not bitten off but the
cut was not clean one so deduced blunt penknife

holmes said you have drawn net round this man from which
he cannot escape and you have saved an innocent human life as
truly as if you had cut the cord which was hanging him see the
direction in which all this points the culprit is

mr john turner cried the hotel waiter opening the door of
our sittingroom and ushering in visitor

the man who entered was strange and impressive figure his
slow limping step and bowed shoulders gave the appearance of
decrepitude and yet his hard deeplined craggy features and
his enormous limbs showed that he was possessed of unusual
strength of body and of character his tangled beard grizzled
hair and outstanding drooping eyebrows combined to give an air
of dignity and power to his appearance but his face was of an
ashen white while his lips and the corners of his nostrils were
tinged with shade of blue it was clear to me at glance that
he was in the grip of some deadly and chronic disease

pray sit down on the sofa said holmes gently you had my
note

yes the lodgekeeper brought it up you said that you wished to
see me here to avoid scandal

thought people would talk if went to the hall

and why did you wish to see me he looked across at my
companion with despair in his weary eyes as though his question
was already answered

yes said holmes answering the look rather than the words it
is so know all about mccarthy

the old man sank his face in his hands god help me he cried
but would not have let the young man come to harm give you
my word that would have spoken out if it went against him at
the assizes

am glad to hear you say so said holmes gravely

would have spoken now had it not been for my dear girl it
would break her heartit will break her heart when she hears
that am arrested

it may not come to that said holmes

what

am no official agent understand that it was your daughter
who required my presence here and am acting in her interests
young mccarthy must be got off however

am dying man said old turner have had diabetes for
years my doctor says it is question whether shall live
month yet would rather die under my own roof than in gaol

holmes rose and sat down at the table with his pen in his hand
and bundle of paper before him just tell us the truth he
said shall jot down the facts you will sign it and watson
here can witness it then could produce your confession at the
last extremity to save young mccarthy promise you that shall
not use it unless it is absolutely needed

its as well said the old man its question whether
shall live to the assizes so it matters little to me but
should wish to spare alice the shock and now will make the
thing clear to you it has been long time in the acting but
will not take me long to tell

you didnt know this dead man mccarthy he was devil
incarnate tell you that god keep you out of the clutches of
such man as he his grip has been upon me these twenty years
and he has blasted my life ill tell you first how came to be
in his power

it was in the early at the diggings was young chap
then hotblooded and reckless ready to turn my hand at
anything got among bad companions took to drink had no luck
with my claim took to the bush and in word became what you
would call over here highway robber there were six of us and
we had wild free life of it sticking up station from time
to time or stopping the wagons on the road to the diggings
black jack of ballarat was the name went under and our party
is still remembered in the colony as the ballarat gang

one day gold convoy came down from ballarat to melbourne and
we lay in wait for it and attacked it there were six troopers
and six of us so it was close thing but we emptied four of
their saddles at the first volley three of our boys were killed
however before we got the swag put my pistol to the head of
the wagondriver who was this very man mccarthy wish to the
lord that had shot him then but spared him though saw his
wicked little eyes fixed on my face as though to remember every
feature we got away with the gold became wealthy men and made
our way over to england without being suspected there parted
from my old pals and determined to settle down to quiet and
respectable life bought this estate which chanced to be in
the market and set myself to do little good with my money
to make up for the way in which had earned it married too
and though my wife died young she left me my dear little alice
even when she was just baby her wee hand seemed to lead me down
the right path as nothing else had ever done in word turned
over new leaf and did my best to make up for the past all was
going well when mccarthy laid his grip upon me

had gone up to town about an investment and met him in
regent street with hardly coat to his back or boot to his
foot

here we are jack says he touching me on the arm well be
as good as family to you theres two of us me and my son and
you can have the keeping of us if you dontits fine
lawabiding country is england and theres always policeman
within hail

well down they came to the west country there was no shaking
them off and there they have lived rent free on my best land
ever since there was no rest for me no peace no forgetfulness
turn where would there was his cunning grinning face at my
elbow it grew worse as alice grew up for he soon saw was more
afraid of her knowing my past than of the police whatever he
wanted he must have and whatever it was gave him without
question land money houses until at last he asked thing
which could not give he asked for alice

his son you see had grown up and so had my girl and as was
known to be in weak health it seemed fine stroke to him that
his lad should step into the whole property but there was
firm would not have his cursed stock mixed with mine not that
had any dislike to the lad but his blood was in him and that
was enough stood firm mccarthy threatened braved him to do
his worst we were to meet at the pool midway between our houses
to talk it over

when went down there found him talking with his son so
smoked cigar and waited behind tree until he should be alone
but as listened to his talk all that was black and bitter in
me seemed to come uppermost he was urging his son to marry my
daughter with as little regard for what she might think as if she
were slut from off the streets it drove me mad to think that
and all that held most dear should be in the power of such
man as this could not snap the bond was already dying and
desperate man though clear of mind and fairly strong of limb
knew that my own fate was sealed but my memory and my girl
both could be saved if could but silence that foul tongue
did it mr holmes would do it again deeply as have sinned
have led life of martyrdom to atone for it but that my girl
should be entangled in the same meshes which held me was more
than could suffer struck him down with no more compunction
than if he had been some foul and venomous beast his cry brought
back his son but had gained the cover of the wood though
was forced to go back to fetch the cloak which had dropped in
my flight that is the true story gentlemen of all that
occurred

well it is not for me to judge you said holmes as the old man
signed the statement which had been drawn out pray that we
may never be exposed to such temptation

pray not sir and what do you intend to do

in view of your health nothing you are yourself aware that you
will soon have to answer for your deed at higher court than the
assizes will keep your confession and if mccarthy is
condemned shall be forced to use it if not it shall never be
seen by mortal eye and your secret whether you be alive or
dead shall be safe with us

farewell then said the old man solemnly your own deathbeds
when they come will be the easier for the thought of the peace
which you have given to mine tottering and shaking in all his
giant frame he stumbled slowly from the room

god help us said holmes after long silence why does fate
play such tricks with poor helpless worms never hear of such
case as this that do not think of baxters words and say
there but for the grace of god goes sherlock holmes

james mccarthy was acquitted at the assizes on the strength of
number of objections which had been drawn out by holmes and
submitted to the defending counsel old turner lived for seven
months after our interview but he is now dead and there is
every prospect that the son and daughter may come to live happily
together in ignorance of the black cloud which rests upon their
past



adventure the five orange pips

when glance over my notes and records of the sherlock holmes
cases between the years and am faced by so many which
present strange and interesting features that it is no easy
matter to know which to choose and which to leave some however
have already gained publicity through the papers and others have
not offered field for those peculiar qualities which my friend
possessed in so high degree and which it is the object of
these papers to illustrate some too have baffled his
analytical skill and would be as narratives beginnings without
an ending while others have been but partially cleared up and
have their explanations founded rather upon conjecture and
surmise than on that absolute logical proof which was so dear to
him there is however one of these last which was so remarkable
in its details and so startling in its results that am tempted
to give some account of it in spite of the fact that there are
points in connection with it which never have been and probably
never will be entirely cleared up

the year furnished us with long series of cases of greater
or less interest of which retain the records among my
headings under this one twelve months find an account of the
adventure of the paradol chamber of the amateur mendicant
society who held luxurious club in the lower vault of
furniture warehouse of the facts connected with the loss of the
british barque sophy anderson of the singular adventures of the
grice patersons in the island of uffa and finally of the
camberwell poisoning case in the latter as may be remembered
sherlock holmes was able by winding up the dead mans watch to
prove that it had been wound up two hours before and that
therefore the deceased had gone to bed within that timea
deduction which was of the greatest importance in clearing up the
case all these may sketch out at some future date but none of
them present such singular features as the strange train of
circumstances which have now taken up my pen to describe

it was in the latter days of september and the equinoctial gales
had set in with exceptional violence all day the wind had
screamed and the rain had beaten against the windows so that
even here in the heart of great handmade london we were forced
to raise our minds for the instant from the routine of life and
to recognise the presence of those great elemental forces which
shriek at mankind through the bars of his civilisation like
untamed beasts in cage as evening drew in the storm grew
higher and louder and the wind cried and sobbed like child in
the chimney sherlock holmes sat moodily at one side of the
fireplace crossindexing his records of crime while at the
other was deep in one of clark russells fine seastories until
the howl of the gale from without seemed to blend with the text
and the splash of the rain to lengthen out into the long swash of
the sea waves my wife was on visit to her mothers and for
few days was dweller once more in my old quarters at baker
street

why said glancing up at my companion that was surely the
bell who could come tonight some friend of yours perhaps

except yourself have none he answered do not encourage
visitors

client then

if so it is serious case nothing less would bring man out
on such day and at such an hour but take it that it is more
likely to be some crony of the landladys

sherlock holmes was wrong in his conjecture however for there
came step in the passage and tapping at the door he
stretched out his long arm to turn the lamp away from himself and
towards the vacant chair upon which newcomer must sit

come in said he

the man who entered was young some twoandtwenty at the
outside wellgroomed and trimly clad with something of
refinement and delicacy in his bearing the streaming umbrella
which he held in his hand and his long shining waterproof told
of the fierce weather through which he had come he looked about
him anxiously in the glare of the lamp and could see that his
face was pale and his eyes heavy like those of man who is
weighed down with some great anxiety

owe you an apology he said raising his golden pincenez to
his eyes trust that am not intruding fear that have
brought some traces of the storm and rain into your snug
chamber

give me your coat and umbrella said holmes they may rest
here on the hook and will be dry presently you have come up from
the southwest see

yes from horsham

that clay and chalk mixture which see upon your toe caps is
quite distinctive

have come for advice

that is easily got

and help

that is not always so easy

have heard of you mr holmes heard from major prendergast
how you saved him in the tankerville club scandal

ah of course he was wrongfully accused of cheating at cards

he said that you could solve anything

he said too much

that you are never beaten

have been beaten four timesthree times by men and once by
woman

but what is that compared with the number of your successes

it is true that have been generally successful

then you may be so with me

beg that you will draw your chair up to the fire and favour me
with some details as to your case

it is no ordinary one

none of those which come to me are am the last court of
appeal

and yet question sir whether in all your experience you
have ever listened to more mysterious and inexplicable chain of
events than those which have happened in my own family

you fill me with interest said holmes pray give us the
essential facts from the commencement and can afterwards
question you as to those details which seem to me to be most
important

the young man pulled his chair up and pushed his wet feet out
towards the blaze

my name said he is john openshaw but my own affairs have
as far as can understand little to do with this awful
business it is hereditary matter so in order to give you an
idea of the facts must go back to the commencement of the
affair

you must know that my grandfather had two sonsmy uncle elias
and my father joseph my father had small factory at coventry
which he enlarged at the time of the invention of bicycling he
was patentee of the openshaw unbreakable tire and his business
met with such success that he was able to sell it and to retire
upon handsome competence

my uncle elias emigrated to america when he was young man and
became planter in florida where he was reported to have done
very well at the time of the war he fought in jacksons army
and afterwards under hood where he rose to be colonel when
lee laid down his arms my uncle returned to his plantation where
he remained for three or four years about or he came
back to europe and took small estate in sussex near horsham
he had made very considerable fortune in the states and his
reason for leaving them was his aversion to the negroes and his
dislike of the republican policy in extending the franchise to
them he was singular man fierce and quicktempered very
foulmouthed when he was angry and of most retiring
disposition during all the years that he lived at horsham
doubt if ever he set foot in the town he had garden and two or
three fields round his house and there he would take his
exercise though very often for weeks on end he would never leave
his room he drank great deal of brandy and smoked very
heavily but he would see no society and did not want any
friends not even his own brother

he didnt mind me in fact he took fancy to me for at the
time when he saw me first was youngster of twelve or so this
would be in the year after he had been eight or nine years
in england he begged my father to let me live with him and he
was very kind to me in his way when he was sober he used to be
fond of playing backgammon and draughts with me and he would
make me his representative both with the servants and with the
tradespeople so that by the time that was sixteen was quite
master of the house kept all the keys and could go where
liked and do what liked so long as did not disturb him in
his privacy there was one singular exception however for he
had single room lumberroom up among the attics which was
invariably locked and which he would never permit either me or
anyone else to enter with boys curiosity have peeped
through the keyhole but was never able to see more than such
collection of old trunks and bundles as would be expected in such
room

one dayit was in march letter with foreign stamp
lay upon the table in front of the colonels plate it was not
common thing for him to receive letters for his bills were all
paid in ready money and he had no friends of any sort from
india said he as he took it up pondicherry postmark what can
this be opening it hurriedly out there jumped five little
dried orange pips which pattered down upon his plate began to
laugh at this but the laugh was struck from my lips at the sight
of his face his lip had fallen his eyes were protruding his
skin the colour of putty and he glared at the envelope which he
still held in his trembling hand he shrieked and
then my god my god my sins have overtaken me

what is it uncle cried

death said he and rising from the table he retired to his
room leaving me palpitating with horror took up the envelope
and saw scrawled in red ink upon the inner flap just above the
gum the letter three times repeated there was nothing else
save the five dried pips what could be the reason of his
overpowering terror left the breakfasttable and as
ascended the stair met him coming down with an old rusty key
which must have belonged to the attic in one hand and small
brass box like cashbox in the other

they may do what they like but ill checkmate them still
said he with an oath tell mary that shall want fire in my
room today and send down to fordham the horsham lawyer

did as he ordered and when the lawyer arrived was asked to
step up to the room the fire was burning brightly and in the
grate there was mass of black fluffy ashes as of burned
paper while the brass box stood open and empty beside it as
glanced at the box noticed with start that upon the lid was
printed the treble which had read in the morning upon the
envelope

wish you john said my uncle to witness my will leave
my estate with all its advantages and all its disadvantages to
my brother your father whence it will no doubt descend to
you if you can enjoy it in peace well and good if you find you
cannot take my advice my boy and leave it to your deadliest
enemy am sorry to give you such twoedged thing but cant
say what turn things are going to take kindly sign the paper
where mr fordham shows you

signed the paper as directed and the lawyer took it away with
him the singular incident made as you may think the deepest
impression upon me and pondered over it and turned it every
way in my mind without being able to make anything of it yet
could not shake off the vague feeling of dread which it left
behind though the sensation grew less keen as the weeks passed
and nothing happened to disturb the usual routine of our lives
could see change in my uncle however he drank more than ever
and he was less inclined for any sort of society most of his
time he would spend in his room with the door locked upon the
inside but sometimes he would emerge in sort of drunken frenzy
and would burst out of the house and tear about the garden with
revolver in his hand screaming out that he was afraid of no man
and that he was not to be cooped up like sheep in pen by
man or devil when these hot fits were over however he would
rush tumultuously in at the door and lock and bar it behind him
like man who can brazen it out no longer against the terror
which lies at the roots of his soul at such times have seen
his face even on cold day glisten with moisture as though it
were new raised from basin

well to come to an end of the matter mr holmes and not to
abuse your patience there came night when he made one of those
drunken sallies from which he never came back we found him when
we went to search for him face downward in little
greenscummed pool which lay at the foot of the garden there
was no sign of any violence and the water was but two feet deep
so that the jury having regard to his known eccentricity
brought in verdict of suicide but who knew how he winced
from the very thought of death had much ado to persuade myself
that he had gone out of his way to meet it the matter passed
however and my father entered into possession of the estate and
of some pounds which lay to his credit at the bank

one moment holmes interposed your statement is foresee
one of the most remarkable to which have ever listened let me
have the date of the reception by your uncle of the letter and
the date of his supposed suicide

the letter arrived on march his death was seven weeks
later upon the night of may

thank you pray proceed

when my father took over the horsham property he at my
request made careful examination of the attic which had been
always locked up we found the brass box there although its
contents had been destroyed on the inside of the cover was
paper label with the initials of repeated upon it and
letters memoranda receipts and register written beneath
these we presume indicated the nature of the papers which had
been destroyed by colonel openshaw for the rest there was
nothing of much importance in the attic save great many
scattered papers and notebooks bearing upon my uncles life in
america some of them were of the war time and showed that he had
done his duty well and had borne the repute of brave soldier
others were of date during the reconstruction of the southern
states and were mostly concerned with politics for he had
evidently taken strong part in opposing the carpetbag
politicians who had been sent down from the north

well it was the beginning of when my father came to live at
horsham and all went as well as possible with us until the
january of on the fourth day after the new year heard my
father give sharp cry of surprise as we sat together at the
breakfasttable there he was sitting with newly opened
envelope in one hand and five dried orange pips in the
outstretched palm of the other one he had always laughed at what
he called my cockandbull story about the colonel but he looked
very scared and puzzled now that the same thing had come upon
himself

why what on earth does this mean john he stammered

my heart had turned to lead it is said

he looked inside the envelope so it is he cried here are
the very letters but what is this written above them

put the papers on the sundial read peeping over his
shoulder

what papers what sundial he asked

the sundial in the garden there is no other said but the
papers must be those that are destroyed

pooh said he gripping hard at his courage we are in
civilised land here and we cant have tomfoolery of this kind
where does the thing come from

from dundee answered glancing at the postmark

some preposterous practical joke said he what have to do
with sundials and papers shall take no notice of such
nonsense

should certainly speak to the police said

and be laughed at for my pains nothing of the sort

then let me do so

no forbid you wont have fuss made about such
nonsense

it was in vain to argue with him for he was very obstinate
man went about however with heart which was full of
forebodings

on the third day after the coming of the letter my father went
from home to visit an old friend of his major freebody who is
in command of one of the forts upon portsdown hill was glad
that he should go for it seemed to me that he was farther from
danger when he was away from home in that however was in
error upon the second day of his absence received telegram
from the major imploring me to come at once my father had
fallen over one of the deep chalkpits which abound in the
neighbourhood and was lying senseless with shattered skull
hurried to him but he passed away without having ever recovered
his consciousness he had as it appears been returning from
fareham in the twilight and as the country was unknown to him
and the chalkpit unfenced the jury had no hesitation in
bringing in verdict of death from accidental causes
carefully as examined every fact connected with his death
was unable to find anything which could suggest the idea of
murder there were no signs of violence no footmarks no
robbery no record of strangers having been seen upon the roads
and yet need not tell you that my mind was far from at ease
and that was wellnigh certain that some foul plot had been
woven round him

in this sinister way came into my inheritance you will ask me
why did not dispose of it answer because was well
convinced that our troubles were in some way dependent upon an
incident in my uncles life and that the danger would be as
pressing in one house as in another

it was in january that my poor father met his end and two
years and eight months have elapsed since then during that time
have lived happily at horsham and had begun to hope that
this curse had passed away from the family and that it had ended
with the last generation had begun to take comfort too soon
however yesterday morning the blow fell in the very shape in
which it had come upon my father

the young man took from his waistcoat crumpled envelope and
turning to the table he shook out upon it five little dried
orange pips

this is the envelope he continued the postmark is
londoneastern division within are the very words which were
upon my fathers last message and then put the
papers on the sundial

what have you done asked holmes

nothing

nothing

to tell the truthhe sank his face into his thin white
handsi have felt helpless have felt like one of those poor
rabbits when the snake is writhing towards it seem to be in
the grasp of some resistless inexorable evil which no foresight
and no precautions can guard against

tut tut cried sherlock holmes you must act man or you are
lost nothing but energy can save you this is no time for
despair

have seen the police

ah

but they listened to my story with smile am convinced that
the inspector has formed the opinion that the letters are all
practical jokes and that the deaths of my relations were really
accidents as the jury stated and were not to be connected with
the warnings

holmes shook his clenched hands in the air incredible
imbecility he cried

they have however allowed me policeman who may remain in
the house with me

has he come with you tonight

no his orders were to stay in the house

again holmes raved in the air

why did you come to me he cried and above all why did you
not come at once

did not know it was only today that spoke to major
prendergast about my troubles and was advised by him to come to
you

it is really two days since you had the letter we should have
acted before this you have no further evidence suppose than
that which you have placed before usno suggestive detail which
might help us

there is one thing said john openshaw he rummaged in his coat
pocket and drawing out piece of discoloured bluetinted
paper he laid it out upon the table have some remembrance
said he that on the day when my uncle burned the papers
observed that the small unburned margins which lay amid the
ashes were of this particular colour found this single sheet
upon the floor of his room and am inclined to think that it
may be one of the papers which has perhaps fluttered out from
among the others and in that way has escaped destruction beyond
the mention of pips do not see that it helps us much think
myself that it is page from some private diary the writing is
undoubtedly my uncles

holmes moved the lamp and we both bent over the sheet of paper
which showed by its ragged edge that it had indeed been torn from
book it was headed march and beneath were the
following enigmatical notices

hudson came same old platform

set the pips on mccauley paramore and
john swain of st augustine

mccauley cleared

john swain cleared

visited paramore all well

thank you said holmes folding up the paper and returning it
to our visitor and now you must on no account lose another
instant we cannot spare time even to discuss what you have told
me you must get home instantly and act

what shall do

there is but one thing to do it must be done at once you must
put this piece of paper which you have shown us into the brass
box which you have described you must also put in note to say
that all the other papers were burned by your uncle and that
this is the only one which remains you must assert that in such
words as will carry conviction with them having done this you
must at once put the box out upon the sundial as directed do
you understand

entirely

do not think of revenge or anything of the sort at present
think that we may gain that by means of the law but we have our
web to weave while theirs is already woven the first
consideration is to remove the pressing danger which threatens
you the second is to clear up the mystery and to punish the
guilty parties

thank you said the young man rising and pulling on his
overcoat you have given me fresh life and hope shall
certainly do as you advise

do not lose an instant and above all take care of yourself in
the meanwhile for do not think that there can be doubt that
you are threatened by very real and imminent danger how do you
go back

by train from waterloo

it is not yet nine the streets will be crowded so trust that
you may be in safety and yet you cannot guard yourself too
closely

am armed

that is well tomorrow shall set to work upon your case

shall see you at horsham then

no your secret lies in london it is there that shall seek
it

then shall call upon you in day or in two days with news
as to the box and the papers shall take your advice in every
particular he shook hands with us and took his leave outside
the wind still screamed and the rain splashed and pattered
against the windows this strange wild story seemed to have come
to us from amid the mad elementsblown in upon us like sheet
of seaweed in galeand now to have been reabsorbed by them
once more

sherlock holmes sat for some time in silence with his head sunk
forward and his eyes bent upon the red glow of the fire then he
lit his pipe and leaning back in his chair he watched the blue
smokerings as they chased each other up to the ceiling

think watson he remarked at last that of all our cases we
have had none more fantastic than this

save perhaps the sign of four

well yes save perhaps that and yet this john openshaw seems
to me to be walking amid even greater perils than did the
sholtos

but have you asked formed any definite conception as to
what these perils are

there can be no question as to their nature he answered

then what are they who is this and why does he pursue
this unhappy family

sherlock holmes closed his eyes and placed his elbows upon the
arms of his chair with his fingertips together the ideal
reasoner he remarked would when he had once been shown
single fact in all its bearings deduce from it not only all the
chain of events which led up to it but also all the results which
would follow from it as cuvier could correctly describe whole
animal by the contemplation of single bone so the observer who
has thoroughly understood one link in series of incidents
should be able to accurately state all the other ones both
before and after we have not yet grasped the results which the
reason alone can attain to problems may be solved in the study
which have baffled all those who have sought solution by the
aid of their senses to carry the art however to its highest
pitch it is necessary that the reasoner should be able to
utilise all the facts which have come to his knowledge and this
in itself implies as you will readily see possession of all
knowledge which even in these days of free education and
encyclopaedias is somewhat rare accomplishment it is not so
impossible however that man should possess all knowledge
which is likely to be useful to him in his work and this have
endeavoured in my case to do if remember rightly you on one
occasion in the early days of our friendship defined my limits
in very precise fashion

yes answered laughing it was singular document
philosophy astronomy and politics were marked at zero
remember botany variable geology profound as regards the
mudstains from any region within fifty miles of town chemistry
eccentric anatomy unsystematic sensational literature and crime
records unique violinplayer boxer swordsman lawyer and
selfpoisoner by cocaine and tobacco those think were the
main points of my analysis

holmes grinned at the last item well he said say now as
said then that man should keep his little brainattic
stocked with all the furniture that he is likely to use and the
rest he can put away in the lumberroom of his library where he
can get it if he wants it now for such case as the one which
has been submitted to us tonight we need certainly to muster
all our resources kindly hand me down the letter of the
american encyclopaedia which stands upon the shelf beside you
thank you now let us consider the situation and see what may be
deduced from it in the first place we may start with strong
presumption that colonel openshaw had some very strong reason for
leaving america men at his time of life do not change all their
habits and exchange willingly the charming climate of florida for
the lonely life of an english provincial town his extreme love
of solitude in england suggests the idea that he was in fear of
someone or something so we may assume as working hypothesis
that it was fear of someone or something which drove him from
america as to what it was he feared we can only deduce that by
considering the formidable letters which were received by himself
and his successors did you remark the postmarks of those
letters

the first was from pondicherry the second from dundee and the
third from london

from east london what do you deduce from that

they are all seaports that the writer was on board of ship

excellent we have already clue there can be no doubt that
the probabilitythe strong probabilityis that the writer was
on board of ship and now let us consider another point in the
case of pondicherry seven weeks elapsed between the threat and
its fulfilment in dundee it was only some three or four days
does that suggest anything

greater distance to travel

but the letter had also greater distance to come

then do not see the point

there is at least presumption that the vessel in which the man
or men are is sailingship it looks as if they always send
their singular warning or token before them when starting upon
their mission you see how quickly the deed followed the sign
when it came from dundee if they had come from pondicherry in
steamer they would have arrived almost as soon as their letter
but as matter of fact seven weeks elapsed think that those
seven weeks represented the difference between the mailboat which
brought the letter and the sailing vessel which brought the
writer

it is possible

more than that it is probable and now you see the deadly
urgency of this new case and why urged young openshaw to
caution the blow has always fallen at the end of the time which
it would take the senders to travel the distance but this one
comes from london and therefore we cannot count upon delay

good god cried what can it mean this relentless
persecution

the papers which openshaw carried are obviously of vital
importance to the person or persons in the sailingship think
that it is quite clear that there must be more than one of them
single man could not have carried out two deaths in such way
as to deceive coroners jury there must have been several in
it and they must have been men of resource and determination
their papers they mean to have be the holder of them who it may
in this way you see ceases to be the initials of an
individual and becomes the badge of society

but of what society

have you never said sherlock holmes bending forward and
sinking his voicehave you never heard of the ku klux klan

never have

holmes turned over the leaves of the book upon his knee here it
is said he presently

ku klux klan name derived from the fanciful resemblance to
the sound produced by cocking rifle this terrible secret
society was formed by some exconfederate soldiers in the
southern states after the civil war and it rapidly formed local
branches in different parts of the country notably in tennessee
louisiana the carolinas georgia and florida its power was
used for political purposes principally for the terrorising of
the negro voters and the murdering and driving from the country
of those who were opposed to its views its outrages were usually
preceded by warning sent to the marked man in some fantastic
but generally recognised shapea sprig of oakleaves in some
parts melon seeds or orange pips in others on receiving this
the victim might either openly abjure his former ways or might
fly from the country if he braved the matter out death would
unfailingly come upon him and usually in some strange and
unforeseen manner so perfect was the organisation of the
society and so systematic its methods that there is hardly
case upon record where any man succeeded in braving it with
impunity or in which any of its outrages were traced home to the
perpetrators for some years the organisation flourished in spite
of the efforts of the united states government and of the better
classes of the community in the south eventually in the year
the movement rather suddenly collapsed although there have
been sporadic outbreaks of the same sort since that date

you will observe said holmes laying down the volume that
the sudden breaking up of the society was coincident with the
disappearance of openshaw from america with their papers it may
well have been cause and effect it is no wonder that he and his
family have some of the more implacable spirits upon their track
you can understand that this register and diary may implicate
some of the first men in the south and that there may be many
who will not sleep easy at night until it is recovered

then the page we have seen

is such as we might expect it ran if remember right sent
the pips to and cthat is sent the societys warning to
them then there are successive entries that and cleared or
left the country and finally that was visited with fear
sinister result for well think doctor that we may let
some light into this dark place and believe that the only
chance young openshaw has in the meantime is to do what have
told him there is nothing more to be said or to be done
tonight so hand me over my violin and let us try to forget for
half an hour the miserable weather and the still more miserable
ways of our fellowmen


it had cleared in the morning and the sun was shining with
subdued brightness through the dim veil which hangs over the
great city sherlock holmes was already at breakfast when came
down

you will excuse me for not waiting for you said he have
foresee very busy day before me in looking into this case of
young openshaws

what steps will you take asked

it will very much depend upon the results of my first inquiries
may have to go down to horsham after all

you will not go there first

no shall commence with the city just ring the bell and the
maid will bring up your coffee

as waited lifted the unopened newspaper from the table and
glanced my eye over it it rested upon heading which sent
chill to my heart

holmes cried you are too late

ah said he laying down his cup feared as much how was it
done he spoke calmly but could see that he was deeply moved

my eye caught the name of openshaw and the heading tragedy
near waterloo bridge here is the account

between nine and ten last night policeconstable cook of the
division on duty near waterloo bridge heard cry for help and
splash in the water the night however was extremely dark and
stormy so that in spite of the help of several passersby it
was quite impossible to effect rescue the alarm however was
given and by the aid of the waterpolice the body was
eventually recovered it proved to be that of young gentleman
whose name as it appears from an envelope which was found in his
pocket was john openshaw and whose residence is near horsham
it is conjectured that he may have been hurrying down to catch
the last train from waterloo station and that in his haste and
the extreme darkness he missed his path and walked over the edge
of one of the small landingplaces for river steamboats the body
exhibited no traces of violence and there can be no doubt that
the deceased had been the victim of an unfortunate accident
which should have the effect of calling the attention of the
authorities to the condition of the riverside landingstages

we sat in silence for some minutes holmes more depressed and
shaken than had ever seen him

that hurts my pride watson he said at last it is petty
feeling no doubt but it hurts my pride it becomes personal
matter with me now and if god sends me health shall set my
hand upon this gang that he should come to me for help and that
should send him away to his death he sprang from his chair
and paced about the room in uncontrollable agitation with
flush upon his sallow cheeks and nervous clasping and
unclasping of his long thin hands

they must be cunning devils he exclaimed at last how could
they have decoyed him down there the embankment is not on the
direct line to the station the bridge no doubt was too
crowded even on such night for their purpose well watson
we shall see who will win in the long run am going out now

to the police

no shall be my own police when have spun the web they may
take the flies but not before

all day was engaged in my professional work and it was late in
the evening before returned to baker street sherlock holmes
had not come back yet it was nearly ten oclock before he
entered looking pale and worn he walked up to the sideboard
and tearing piece from the loaf he devoured it voraciously
washing it down with long draught of water

you are hungry remarked

starving it had escaped my memory have had nothing since
breakfast

nothing

not bite had no time to think of it

and how have you succeeded

well

you have clue

have them in the hollow of my hand young openshaw shall not
long remain unavenged why watson let us put their own devilish
trademark upon them it is well thought of

what do you mean

he took an orange from the cupboard and tearing it to pieces he
squeezed out the pips upon the table of these he took five and
thrust them into an envelope on the inside of the flap he wrote
for then he sealed it and addressed it to captain
james calhoun barque lone star savannah georgia

that will await him when he enters port said he chuckling
it may give him sleepless night he will find it as sure
precursor of his fate as openshaw did before him

and who is this captain calhoun

the leader of the gang shall have the others but he first

how did you trace it then

he took large sheet of paper from his pocket all covered with
dates and names

have spent the whole day said he over lloyds registers
and files of the old papers following the future career of every
vessel which touched at pondicherry in january and february in
there were thirtysix ships of fair tonnage which were
reported there during those months of these one the lone star
instantly attracted my attention since although it was reported
as having cleared from london the name is that which is given to
one of the states of the union

texas think

was not and am not sure which but knew that the ship must
have an american origin

what then

searched the dundee records and when found that the barque
lone star was there in january my suspicion became
certainty then inquired as to the vessels which lay at present
in the port of london

yes

the lone star had arrived here last week went down to the
albert dock and found that she had been taken down the river by
the early tide this morning homeward bound to savannah wired
to gravesend and learned that she had passed some time ago and
as the wind is easterly have no doubt that she is now past the
goodwins and not very far from the isle of wight

what will you do then

oh have my hand upon him he and the two mates are as
learn the only nativeborn americans in the ship the others are
finns and germans know also that they were all three away
from the ship last night had it from the stevedore who has
been loading their cargo by the time that their sailingship
reaches savannah the mailboat will have carried this letter and
the cable will have informed the police of savannah that these
three gentlemen are badly wanted here upon charge of murder

there is ever flaw however in the best laid of human plans
and the murderers of john openshaw were never to receive the
orange pips which would show them that another as cunning and as
resolute as themselves was upon their track very long and very
severe were the equinoctial gales that year we waited long for
news of the lone star of savannah but none ever reached us we
did at last hear that somewhere far out in the atlantic
shattered sternpost of boat was seen swinging in the trough
of wave with the letters carved upon it and that is
all which we shall ever know of the fate of the lone star



adventure vi the man with the twisted lip

isa whitney brother of the late elias whitney dd principal
of the theological college of st georges was much addicted to
opium the habit grew upon him as understand from some
foolish freak when he was at college for having read de
quinceys description of his dreams and sensations he had
drenched his tobacco with laudanum in an attempt to produce the
same effects he found as so many more have done that the
practice is easier to attain than to get rid of and for many
years he continued to be slave to the drug an object of
mingled horror and pity to his friends and relatives can see
him now with yellow pasty face drooping lids and pinpoint
pupils all huddled in chair the wreck and ruin of noble
man

one nightit was in june came ring to my bell
about the hour when man gives his first yawn and glances at the
clock sat up in my chair and my wife laid her needlework
down in her lap and made little face of disappointment

patient said she youll have to go out

groaned for was newly come back from weary day

we heard the door open few hurried words and then quick steps
upon the linoleum our own door flew open and lady clad in
some darkcoloured stuff with black veil entered the room

you will excuse my calling so late she began and then
suddenly losing her selfcontrol she ran forward threw her arms
about my wifes neck and sobbed upon her shoulder oh im in
such trouble she cried do so want little help

why said my wife pulling up her veil it is kate whitney
how you startled me kate had not an idea who you were when
you came in

didnt know what to do so came straight to you that was
always the way folk who were in grief came to my wife like birds
to lighthouse

it was very sweet of you to come now you must have some wine
and water and sit here comfortably and tell us all about it or
should you rather that sent james off to bed

oh no no want the doctors advice and help too its about
isa he has not been home for two days am so frightened about
him

it was not the first time that she had spoken to us of her
husbands trouble to me as doctor to my wife as an old friend
and school companion we soothed and comforted her by such words
as we could find did she know where her husband was was it
possible that we could bring him back to her

it seems that it was she had the surest information that of late
he had when the fit was on him made use of an opium den in the
farthest east of the city hitherto his orgies had always been
confined to one day and he had come back twitching and
shattered in the evening but now the spell had been upon him
eightandforty hours and he lay there doubtless among the
dregs of the docks breathing in the poison or sleeping off the
effects there he was to be found she was sure of it at the bar
of gold in upper swandam lane but what was she to do how could
she young and timid woman make her way into such place and
pluck her husband out from among the ruffians who surrounded him

there was the case and of course there was but one way out of
it might not escort her to this place and then as second
thought why should she come at all was isa whitneys medical
adviser and as such had influence over him could manage it
better if were alone promised her on my word that would
send him home in cab within two hours if he were indeed at the
address which she had given me and so in ten minutes had left
my armchair and cheery sittingroom behind me and was speeding
eastward in hansom on strange errand as it seemed to me at
the time though the future only could show how strange it was to
be

but there was no great difficulty in the first stage of my
adventure upper swandam lane is vile alley lurking behind the
high wharves which line the north side of the river to the east
of london bridge between slopshop and ginshop approached
by steep flight of steps leading down to black gap like the
mouth of cave found the den of which was in search
ordering my cab to wait passed down the steps worn hollow in
the centre by the ceaseless tread of drunken feet and by the
light of flickering oillamp above the door found the latch
and made my way into long low room thick and heavy with the
brown opium smoke and terraced with wooden berths like the
forecastle of an emigrant ship

through the gloom one could dimly catch glimpse of bodies lying
in strange fantastic poses bowed shoulders bent knees heads
thrown back and chins pointing upward with here and there
dark lacklustre eye turned upon the newcomer out of the black
shadows there glimmered little red circles of light now bright
now faint as the burning poison waxed or waned in the bowls of
the metal pipes the most lay silent but some muttered to
themselves and others talked together in strange low
monotonous voice their conversation coming in gushes and then
suddenly tailing off into silence each mumbling out his own
thoughts and paying little heed to the words of his neighbour at
the farther end was small brazier of burning charcoal beside
which on threelegged wooden stool there sat tall thin old
man with his jaw resting upon his two fists and his elbows upon
his knees staring into the fire

as entered sallow malay attendant had hurried up with pipe
for me and supply of the drug beckoning me to an empty berth

thank you have not come to stay said there is friend
of mine here mr isa whitney and wish to speak with him

there was movement and an exclamation from my right and
peering through the gloom saw whitney pale haggard and
unkempt staring out at me

my god its watson said he he was in pitiable state of
reaction with every nerve in twitter say watson what
oclock is it

nearly eleven

of what day

of friday june

good heavens thought it was wednesday it is wednesday what
dyou want to frighten chap for he sank his face onto his
arms and began to sob in high treble key

tell you that it is friday man your wife has been waiting
this two days for you you should be ashamed of yourself

so am but youve got mixed watson for have only been here
few hours three pipes four pipesi forget how many but ill
go home with you wouldnt frighten katepoor little kate
give me your hand have you cab

yes have one waiting

then shall go in it but must owe something find what
owe watson am all off colour can do nothing for myself

walked down the narrow passage between the double row of
sleepers holding my breath to keep out the vile stupefying
fumes of the drug and looking about for the manager as passed
the tall man who sat by the brazier felt sudden pluck at my
skirt and low voice whispered walk past me and then look
back at me the words fell quite distinctly upon my ear
glanced down they could only have come from the old man at my
side and yet he sat now as absorbed as ever very thin very
wrinkled bent with age an opium pipe dangling down from between
his knees as though it had dropped in sheer lassitude from his
fingers took two steps forward and looked back it took all my
selfcontrol to prevent me from breaking out into cry of
astonishment he had turned his back so that none could see him
but his form had filled out his wrinkles were gone the dull
eyes had regained their fire and there sitting by the fire and
grinning at my surprise was none other than sherlock holmes he
made slight motion to me to approach him and instantly as he
turned his face half round to the company once more subsided
into doddering looselipped senility

holmes whispered what on earth are you doing in this den

as low as you can he answered have excellent ears if you
would have the great kindness to get rid of that sottish friend
of yours should be exceedingly glad to have little talk with
you

have cab outside

then pray send him home in it you may safely trust him for he
appears to be too limp to get into any mischief should
recommend you also to send note by the cabman to your wife to
say that you have thrown in your lot with me if you will wait
outside shall be with you in five minutes

it was difficult to refuse any of sherlock holmes requests for
they were always so exceedingly definite and put forward with
such quiet air of mastery felt however that when whitney
was once confined in the cab my mission was practically
accomplished and for the rest could not wish anything better
than to be associated with my friend in one of those singular
adventures which were the normal condition of his existence in
few minutes had written my note paid whitneys bill led him
out to the cab and seen him driven through the darkness in
very short time decrepit figure had emerged from the opium den
and was walking down the street with sherlock holmes for two
streets he shuffled along with bent back and an uncertain foot
then glancing quickly round he straightened himself out and
burst into hearty fit of laughter

suppose watson said he that you imagine that have added
opiumsmoking to cocaine injections and all the other little
weaknesses on which you have favoured me with your medical
views

was certainly surprised to find you there

but not more so than to find you

came to find friend

and to find an enemy

an enemy

yes one of my natural enemies or shall say my natural
prey briefly watson am in the midst of very remarkable
inquiry and have hoped to find clue in the incoherent
ramblings of these sots as have done before now had been
recognised in that den my life would not have been worth an
hours purchase for have used it before now for my own
purposes and the rascally lascar who runs it has sworn to have
vengeance upon me there is trapdoor at the back of that
building near the corner of pauls wharf which could tell some
strange tales of what has passed through it upon the moonless
nights

what you do not mean bodies

ay bodies watson we should be rich men if we had pounds
for every poor devil who has been done to death in that den it
is the vilest murdertrap on the whole riverside and fear that
neville st clair has entered it never to leave it more but our
trap should be here he put his two forefingers between his
teeth and whistled shrillya signal which was answered by
similar whistle from the distance followed shortly by the rattle
of wheels and the clink of horses hoofs

now watson said holmes as tall dogcart dashed up through
the gloom throwing out two golden tunnels of yellow light from
its side lanterns youll come with me wont you

if can be of use

oh trusty comrade is always of use and chronicler still
more so my room at the cedars is doublebedded one

the cedars

yes that is mr st clairs house am staying there while
conduct the inquiry

where is it then

near lee in kent we have sevenmile drive before us

but am all in the dark

of course you are youll know all about it presently jump up
here all right john we shall not need you heres half
crown look out for me tomorrow about eleven give her her
head so long then

he flicked the horse with his whip and we dashed away through
the endless succession of sombre and deserted streets which
widened gradually until we were flying across broad
balustraded bridge with the murky river flowing sluggishly
beneath us beyond lay another dull wilderness of bricks and
mortar its silence broken only by the heavy regular footfall of
the policeman or the songs and shouts of some belated party of
revellers dull wrack was drifting slowly across the sky and
star or two twinkled dimly here and there through the rifts of
the clouds holmes drove in silence with his head sunk upon his
breast and the air of man who is lost in thought while sat
beside him curious to learn what this new quest might be which
seemed to tax his powers so sorely and yet afraid to break in
upon the current of his thoughts we had driven several miles
and were beginning to get to the fringe of the belt of suburban
villas when he shook himself shrugged his shoulders and lit up
his pipe with the air of man who has satisfied himself that he
is acting for the best

you have grand gift of silence watson said he it makes
you quite invaluable as companion pon my word it is great
thing for me to have someone to talk to for my own thoughts are
not overpleasant was wondering what should say to this dear
little woman tonight when she meets me at the door

you forget that know nothing about it

shall just have time to tell you the facts of the case before
we get to lee it seems absurdly simple and yet somehow can
get nothing to go upon theres plenty of thread no doubt but
cant get the end of it into my hand now ill state the case
clearly and concisely to you watson and maybe you can see
spark where all is dark to me

proceed then

some years agoto be definite in may came to lee
gentleman neville st clair by name who appeared to have
plenty of money he took large villa laid out the grounds very
nicely and lived generally in good style by degrees he made
friends in the neighbourhood and in he married the daughter
of local brewer by whom he now has two children he had no
occupation but was interested in several companies and went into
town as rule in the morning returning by the from cannon
street every night mr st clair is now thirtyseven years of
age is man of temperate habits good husband very
affectionate father and man who is popular with all who know
him may add that his whole debts at the present moment as far
as we have been able to ascertain amount to pounds while
he has pounds standing to his credit in the capital and
counties bank there is no reason therefore to think that money
troubles have been weighing upon his mind

last monday mr neville st clair went into town rather earlier
than usual remarking before he started that he had two important
commissions to perform and that he would bring his little boy
home box of bricks now by the merest chance his wife
received telegram upon this same monday very shortly after his
departure to the effect that small parcel of considerable
value which she had been expecting was waiting for her at the
offices of the aberdeen shipping company now if you are well up
in your london you will know that the office of the company is
in fresno street which branches out of upper swandam lane where
you found me tonight mrs st clair had her lunch started for
the city did some shopping proceeded to the companys office
got her packet and found herself at exactly walking through
swandam lane on her way back to the station have you followed me
so far

it is very clear

if you remember monday was an exceedingly hot day and mrs st
clair walked slowly glancing about in the hope of seeing cab
as she did not like the neighbourhood in which she found herself
while she was walking in this way down swandam lane she suddenly
heard an ejaculation or cry and was struck cold to see her
husband looking down at her and as it seemed to her beckoning
to her from secondfloor window the window was open and she
distinctly saw his face which she describes as being terribly
agitated he waved his hands frantically to her and then
vanished from the window so suddenly that it seemed to her that
he had been plucked back by some irresistible force from behind
one singular point which struck her quick feminine eye was that
although he wore some dark coat such as he had started to town
in he had on neither collar nor necktie

convinced that something was amiss with him she rushed down the
stepsfor the house was none other than the opium den in which
you found me tonightand running through the front room she
attempted to ascend the stairs which led to the first floor at
the foot of the stairs however she met this lascar scoundrel of
whom have spoken who thrust her back and aided by dane who
acts as assistant there pushed her out into the street filled
with the most maddening doubts and fears she rushed down the
lane and by rare goodfortune met in fresno street number of
constables with an inspector all on their way to their beat the
inspector and two men accompanied her back and in spite of the
continued resistance of the proprietor they made their way to
the room in which mr st clair had last been seen there was no
sign of him there in fact in the whole of that floor there was
no one to be found save crippled wretch of hideous aspect who
it seems made his home there both he and the lascar stoutly
swore that no one else had been in the front room during the
afternoon so determined was their denial that the inspector was
staggered and had almost come to believe that mrs st clair had
been deluded when with cry she sprang at small deal box
which lay upon the table and tore the lid from it out there fell
cascade of childrens bricks it was the toy which he had
promised to bring home

this discovery and the evident confusion which the cripple
showed made the inspector realise that the matter was serious
the rooms were carefully examined and results all pointed to an
abominable crime the front room was plainly furnished as
sittingroom and led into small bedroom which looked out upon
the back of one of the wharves between the wharf and the bedroom
window is narrow strip which is dry at low tide but is covered
at high tide with at least four and half feet of water the
bedroom window was broad one and opened from below on
examination traces of blood were to be seen upon the windowsill
and several scattered drops were visible upon the wooden floor of
the bedroom thrust away behind curtain in the front room were
all the clothes of mr neville st clair with the exception of
his coat his boots his socks his hat and his watchall were
there there were no signs of violence upon any of these
garments and there were no other traces of mr neville st
clair out of the window he must apparently have gone for no
other exit could be discovered and the ominous bloodstains upon
the sill gave little promise that he could save himself by
swimming for the tide was at its very highest at the moment of
the tragedy

and now as to the villains who seemed to be immediately
implicated in the matter the lascar was known to be man of the
vilest antecedents but as by mrs st clairs story he was
known to have been at the foot of the stair within very few
seconds of her husbands appearance at the window he could
hardly have been more than an accessory to the crime his defence
was one of absolute ignorance and he protested that he had no
knowledge as to the doings of hugh boone his lodger and that he
could not account in any way for the presence of the missing
gentlemans clothes

so much for the lascar manager now for the sinister cripple who
lives upon the second floor of the opium den and who was
certainly the last human being whose eyes rested upon neville st
clair his name is hugh boone and his hideous face is one which
is familiar to every man who goes much to the city he is
professional beggar though in order to avoid the police
regulations he pretends to small trade in wax vestas some
little distance down threadneedle street upon the lefthand
side there is as you may have remarked small angle in the
wall here it is that this creature takes his daily seat
crosslegged with his tiny stock of matches on his lap and as he
is piteous spectacle small rain of charity descends into the
greasy leather cap which lies upon the pavement beside him
have watched the fellow more than once before ever thought of
making his professional acquaintance and have been surprised
at the harvest which he has reaped in short time his
appearance you see is so remarkable that no one can pass him
without observing him shock of orange hair pale face
disfigured by horrible scar which by its contraction has
turned up the outer edge of his upper lip bulldog chin and
pair of very penetrating dark eyes which present singular
contrast to the colour of his hair all mark him out from amid
the common crowd of mendicants and so too does his wit for he
is ever ready with reply to any piece of chaff which may be
thrown at him by the passersby this is the man whom we now
learn to have been the lodger at the opium den and to have been
the last man to see the gentleman of whom we are in quest

but cripple said what could he have done singlehanded
against man in the prime of life

he is cripple in the sense that he walks with limp but in
other respects he appears to be powerful and wellnurtured man
surely your medical experience would tell you watson that
weakness in one limb is often compensated for by exceptional
strength in the others

pray continue your narrative

mrs st clair had fainted at the sight of the blood upon the
window and she was escorted home in cab by the police as her
presence could be of no help to them in their investigations
inspector barton who had charge of the case made very careful
examination of the premises but without finding anything which
threw any light upon the matter one mistake had been made in not
arresting boone instantly as he was allowed some few minutes
during which he might have communicated with his friend the
lascar but this fault was soon remedied and he was seized and
searched without anything being found which could incriminate
him there were it is true some bloodstains upon his right
shirtsleeve but he pointed to his ringfinger which had been
cut near the nail and explained that the bleeding came from
there adding that he had been to the window not long before and
that the stains which had been observed there came doubtless from
the same source he denied strenuously having ever seen mr
neville st clair and swore that the presence of the clothes in
his room was as much mystery to him as to the police as to
mrs st clairs assertion that she had actually seen her husband
at the window he declared that she must have been either mad or
dreaming he was removed loudly protesting to the
policestation while the inspector remained upon the premises in
the hope that the ebbing tide might afford some fresh clue

and it did though they hardly found upon the mudbank what they
had feared to find it was neville st clairs coat and not
neville st clair which lay uncovered as the tide receded and
what do you think they found in the pockets

cannot imagine

no dont think you would guess every pocket stuffed with
pennies and pennies and halfpennies it
was no wonder that it had not been swept away by the tide but
human body is different matter there is fierce eddy between
the wharf and the house it seemed likely enough that the
weighted coat had remained when the stripped body had been sucked
away into the river

but understand that all the other clothes were found in the
room would the body be dressed in coat alone

no sir but the facts might be met speciously enough suppose
that this man boone had thrust neville st clair through the
window there is no human eye which could have seen the deed
what would he do then it would of course instantly strike him
that he must get rid of the telltale garments he would seize
the coat then and be in the act of throwing it out when it
would occur to him that it would swim and not sink he has little
time for he has heard the scuffle downstairs when the wife tried
to force her way up and perhaps he has already heard from his
lascar confederate that the police are hurrying up the street
there is not an instant to be lost he rushes to some secret
hoard where he has accumulated the fruits of his beggary and he
stuffs all the coins upon which he can lay his hands into the
pockets to make sure of the coats sinking he throws it out and
would have done the same with the other garments had not he heard
the rush of steps below and only just had time to close the
window when the police appeared

it certainly sounds feasible

well we will take it as working hypothesis for want of
better boone as have told you was arrested and taken to the
station but it could not be shown that there had ever before
been anything against him he had for years been known as
professional beggar but his life appeared to have been very
quiet and innocent one there the matter stands at present and
the questions which have to be solvedwhat neville st clair was
doing in the opium den what happened to him when there where is
he now and what hugh boone had to do with his disappearanceare
all as far from solution as ever confess that cannot
recall any case within my experience which looked at the first
glance so simple and yet which presented such difficulties

while sherlock holmes had been detailing this singular series of
events we had been whirling through the outskirts of the great
town until the last straggling houses had been left behind and
we rattled along with country hedge upon either side of us
just as he finished however we drove through two scattered
villages where few lights still glimmered in the windows

we are on the outskirts of lee said my companion we have
touched on three english counties in our short drive starting in
middlesex passing over an angle of surrey and ending in kent
see that light among the trees that is the cedars and beside
that lamp sits woman whose anxious ears have already have
little doubt caught the clink of our horses feet

but why are you not conducting the case from baker street
asked

because there are many inquiries which must be made out here
mrs st clair has most kindly put two rooms at my disposal and
you may rest assured that she will have nothing but welcome for
my friend and colleague hate to meet her watson when have
no news of her husband here we are whoa there whoa

we had pulled up in front of large villa which stood within its
own grounds stableboy had run out to the horses head and
springing down followed holmes up the small winding
graveldrive which led to the house as we approached the door
flew open and little blonde woman stood in the opening clad
in some sort of light mousseline de soie with touch of fluffy
pink chiffon at her neck and wrists she stood with her figure
outlined against the flood of light one hand upon the door one
halfraised in her eagerness her body slightly bent her head
and face protruded with eager eyes and parted lips standing
question

well she cried well and then seeing that there were two
of us she gave cry of hope which sank into groan as she saw
that my companion shook his head and shrugged his shoulders

no good news

none

no bad

no

thank god for that but come in you must be weary for you have
had long day

this is my friend dr watson he has been of most vital use to
me in several of my cases and lucky chance has made it
possible for me to bring him out and associate him with this
investigation

am delighted to see you said she pressing my hand warmly
you will am sure forgive anything that may be wanting in our
arrangements when you consider the blow which has come so
suddenly upon us

my dear madam said am an old campaigner and if were
not can very well see that no apology is needed if can be of
any assistance either to you or to my friend here shall be
indeed happy

now mr sherlock holmes said the lady as we entered
welllit diningroom upon the table of which cold supper had
been laid out should very much like to ask you one or two
plain questions to which beg that you will give plain
answer

certainly madam

do not trouble about my feelings am not hysterical nor given
to fainting simply wish to hear your real real opinion

upon what point

in your heart of hearts do you think that neville is alive

sherlock holmes seemed to be embarrassed by the question
frankly now she repeated standing upon the rug and looking
keenly down at him as he leaned back in basketchair

frankly then madam do not

you think that he is dead

do

murdered

dont say that perhaps

and on what day did he meet his death

on monday

then perhaps mr holmes you will be good enough to explain how
it is that have received letter from him today

sherlock holmes sprang out of his chair as if he had been
galvanised

what he roared

yes today she stood smiling holding up little slip of
paper in the air

may see it

certainly

he snatched it from her in his eagerness and smoothing it out
upon the table he drew over the lamp and examined it intently
had left my chair and was gazing at it over his shoulder the
envelope was very coarse one and was stamped with the gravesend
postmark and with the date of that very day or rather of the day
before for it was considerably after midnight

coarse writing murmured holmes surely this is not your
husbands writing madam

no but the enclosure is

perceive also that whoever addressed the envelope had to go
and inquire as to the address

how can you tell that

the name you see is in perfectly black ink which has dried
itself the rest is of the greyish colour which shows that
blottingpaper has been used if it had been written straight
off and then blotted none would be of deep black shade this
man has written the name and there has then been pause before
he wrote the address which can only mean that he was not
familiar with it it is of course trifle but there is
nothing so important as trifles let us now see the letter ha
there has been an enclosure here

yes there was ring his signetring

and you are sure that this is your husbands hand

one of his hands

one

his hand when he wrote hurriedly it is very unlike his usual
writing and yet know it well

dearest do not be frightened all will come well there is
huge error which it may take some little time to rectify
wait in patienceneville written in pencil upon the flyleaf
of book octavo size no watermark hum posted today in
gravesend by man with dirty thumb ha and the flap has been
gummed if am not very much in error by person who had been
chewing tobacco and you have no doubt that it is your husbands
hand madam

none neville wrote those words

and they were posted today at gravesend well mrs st clair
the clouds lighten though should not venture to say that the
danger is over

but he must be alive mr holmes

unless this is clever forgery to put us on the wrong scent
the ring after all proves nothing it may have been taken from
him

no no it is it is his very own writing

very well it may however have been written on monday and only
posted today

that is possible

if so much may have happened between

oh you must not discourage me mr holmes know that all is
well with him there is so keen sympathy between us that
should know if evil came upon him on the very day that saw him
last he cut himself in the bedroom and yet in the diningroom
rushed upstairs instantly with the utmost certainty that
something had happened do you think that would respond to such
trifle and yet be ignorant of his death

have seen too much not to know that the impression of woman
may be more valuable than the conclusion of an analytical
reasoner and in this letter you certainly have very strong
piece of evidence to corroborate your view but if your husband
is alive and able to write letters why should he remain away
from you

cannot imagine it is unthinkable

and on monday he made no remarks before leaving you

no

and you were surprised to see him in swandam lane

very much so

was the window open

yes

then he might have called to you

he might

he only as understand gave an inarticulate cry

yes

call for help you thought

yes he waved his hands

but it might have been cry of surprise astonishment at the
unexpected sight of you might cause him to throw up his hands

it is possible

and you thought he was pulled back

he disappeared so suddenly

he might have leaped back you did not see anyone else in the
room

no but this horrible man confessed to having been there and
the lascar was at the foot of the stairs

quite so your husband as far as you could see had his
ordinary clothes on

but without his collar or tie distinctly saw his bare
throat

had he ever spoken of swandam lane

never

had he ever showed any signs of having taken opium

never

thank you mrs st clair those are the principal points about
which wished to be absolutely clear we shall now have little
supper and then retire for we may have very busy day
tomorrow

large and comfortable doublebedded room had been placed at our
disposal and was quickly between the sheets for was weary
after my night of adventure sherlock holmes was man however
who when he had an unsolved problem upon his mind would go for
days and even for week without rest turning it over
rearranging his facts looking at it from every point of view
until he had either fathomed it or convinced himself that his
data were insufficient it was soon evident to me that he was now
preparing for an allnight sitting he took off his coat and
waistcoat put on large blue dressinggown and then wandered
about the room collecting pillows from his bed and cushions from
the sofa and armchairs with these he constructed sort of
eastern divan upon which he perched himself crosslegged with
an ounce of shag tobacco and box of matches laid out in front
of him in the dim light of the lamp saw him sitting there an
old briar pipe between his lips his eyes fixed vacantly upon the
corner of the ceiling the blue smoke curling up from him
silent motionless with the light shining upon his strongset
aquiline features so he sat as dropped off to sleep and so he
sat when sudden ejaculation caused me to wake up and found
the summer sun shining into the apartment the pipe was still
between his lips the smoke still curled upward and the room was
full of dense tobacco haze but nothing remained of the heap of
shag which had seen upon the previous night

awake watson he asked

yes

game for morning drive

certainly

then dress no one is stirring yet but know where the
stableboy sleeps and we shall soon have the trap out he
chuckled to himself as he spoke his eyes twinkled and he seemed
different man to the sombre thinker of the previous night

as dressed glanced at my watch it was no wonder that no one
was stirring it was twentyfive minutes past four had hardly
finished when holmes returned with the news that the boy was
putting in the horse

want to test little theory of mine said he pulling on his
boots think watson that you are now standing in the
presence of one of the most absolute fools in europe deserve
to be kicked from here to charing cross but think have the
key of the affair now

and where is it asked smiling

in the bathroom he answered oh yes am not joking he
continued seeing my look of incredulity have just been
there and have taken it out and have got it in this
gladstone bag come on my boy and we shall see whether it will
not fit the lock

we made our way downstairs as quietly as possible and out into
the bright morning sunshine in the road stood our horse and
trap with the halfclad stableboy waiting at the head we both
sprang in and away we dashed down the london road few country
carts were stirring bearing in vegetables to the metropolis but
the lines of villas on either side were as silent and lifeless as
some city in dream

it has been in some points singular case said holmes
flicking the horse on into gallop confess that have been
as blind as mole but it is better to learn wisdom late than
never to learn it at all

in town the earliest risers were just beginning to look sleepily
from their windows as we drove through the streets of the surrey
side passing down the waterloo bridge road we crossed over the
river and dashing up wellington street wheeled sharply to the
right and found ourselves in bow street sherlock holmes was well
known to the force and the two constables at the door saluted
him one of them held the horses head while the other led us in

who is on duty asked holmes

inspector bradstreet sir

ah bradstreet how are you tall stout official had come
down the stoneflagged passage in peaked cap and frogged
jacket wish to have quiet word with you bradstreet
certainly mr holmes step into my room here it was small
officelike room with huge ledger upon the table and
telephone projecting from the wall the inspector sat down at his
desk

what can do for you mr holmes

called about that beggarman boonethe one who was charged
with being concerned in the disappearance of mr neville st
clair of lee

yes he was brought up and remanded for further inquiries

so heard you have him here

in the cells

is he quiet

oh he gives no trouble but he is dirty scoundrel

dirty

yes it is all we can do to make him wash his hands and his
face is as black as tinkers well when once his case has been
settled he will have regular prison bath and think if you
saw him you would agree with me that he needed it

should like to see him very much

would you that is easily done come this way you can leave
your bag

no think that ill take it

very good come this way if you please he led us down
passage opened barred door passed down winding stair and
brought us to whitewashed corridor with line of doors on each
side

the third on the right is his said the inspector here it
is he quietly shot back panel in the upper part of the door
and glanced through

he is asleep said he you can see him very well

we both put our eyes to the grating the prisoner lay with his
face towards us in very deep sleep breathing slowly and
heavily he was middlesized man coarsely clad as became his
calling with coloured shirt protruding through the rent in his
tattered coat he was as the inspector had said extremely
dirty but the grime which covered his face could not conceal its
repulsive ugliness broad wheal from an old scar ran right
across it from eye to chin and by its contraction had turned up
one side of the upper lip so that three teeth were exposed in
perpetual snarl shock of very bright red hair grew low over
his eyes and forehead

hes beauty isnt he said the inspector

he certainly needs wash remarked holmes had an idea that
he might and took the liberty of bringing the tools with me
he opened the gladstone bag as he spoke and took out to my
astonishment very large bathsponge

he he you are funny one chuckled the inspector

now if you will have the great goodness to open that door very
quietly we will soon make him cut much more respectable
figure

well dont know why not said the inspector he doesnt
look credit to the bow street cells does he he slipped his
key into the lock and we all very quietly entered the cell the
sleeper half turned and then settled down once more into deep
slumber holmes stooped to the waterjug moistened his sponge
and then rubbed it twice vigorously across and down the
prisoners face

let me introduce you he shouted to mr neville st clair of
lee in the county of kent

never in my life have seen such sight the mans face peeled
off under the sponge like the bark from tree gone was the
coarse brown tint gone too was the horrid scar which had
seamed it across and the twisted lip which had given the
repulsive sneer to the face twitch brought away the tangled
red hair and there sitting up in his bed was pale
sadfaced refinedlooking man blackhaired and smoothskinned
rubbing his eyes and staring about him with sleepy bewilderment
then suddenly realising the exposure he broke into scream and
threw himself down with his face to the pillow

great heavens cried the inspector it is indeed the missing
man know him from the photograph

the prisoner turned with the reckless air of man who abandons
himself to his destiny be it so said he and pray what am
charged with

with making away with mr neville st oh come you cant be
charged with that unless they make case of attempted suicide of
it said the inspector with grin well have been
twentyseven years in the force but this really takes the cake

if am mr neville st clair then it is obvious that no crime
has been committed and that therefore am illegally
detained

no crime but very great error has been committed said
holmes you would have done better to have trusted your wife

it was not the wife it was the children groaned the prisoner
god help me would not have them ashamed of their father my
god what an exposure what can do

sherlock holmes sat down beside him on the couch and patted him
kindly on the shoulder

if you leave it to court of law to clear the matter up said
he of course you can hardly avoid publicity on the other hand
if you convince the police authorities that there is no possible
case against you do not know that there is any reason that the
details should find their way into the papers inspector
bradstreet would am sure make notes upon anything which you
might tell us and submit it to the proper authorities the case
would then never go into court at all

god bless you cried the prisoner passionately would have
endured imprisonment ay even execution rather than have left
my miserable secret as family blot to my children

you are the first who have ever heard my story my father was
schoolmaster in chesterfield where received an excellent
education travelled in my youth took to the stage and
finally became reporter on an evening paper in london one day
my editor wished to have series of articles upon begging in the
metropolis and volunteered to supply them there was the point
from which all my adventures started it was only by trying
begging as an amateur that could get the facts upon which to
base my articles when an actor had of course learned all the
secrets of making up and had been famous in the greenroom for
my skill took advantage now of my attainments painted my
face and to make myself as pitiable as possible made good
scar and fixed one side of my lip in twist by the aid of
small slip of fleshcoloured plaster then with red head of
hair and an appropriate dress took my station in the business
part of the city ostensibly as matchseller but really as
beggar for seven hours plied my trade and when returned
home in the evening found to my surprise that had received no
less than

wrote my articles and thought little more of the matter until
some time later backed bill for friend and had writ
served upon me for pounds was at my wits end where to get
the money but sudden idea came to me begged fortnights
grace from the creditor asked for holiday from my employers
and spent the time in begging in the city under my disguise in
ten days had the money and had paid the debt

well you can imagine how hard it was to settle down to arduous
work at pounds week when knew that could earn as much in
day by smearing my face with little paint laying my cap on
the ground and sitting still it was long fight between my
pride and the money but the dollars won at last and threw up
reporting and sat day after day in the corner which had first
chosen inspiring pity by my ghastly face and filling my pockets
with coppers only one man knew my secret he was the keeper of
low den in which used to lodge in swandam lane where could
every morning emerge as squalid beggar and in the evenings
transform myself into welldressed man about town this fellow
lascar was well paid by me for his rooms so that knew that
my secret was safe in his possession

well very soon found that was saving considerable sums of
money do not mean that any beggar in the streets of london
could earn pounds yearwhich is less than my average
takingsbut had exceptional advantages in my power of making
up and also in facility of repartee which improved by
practice and made me quite recognised character in the city
all day stream of pennies varied by silver poured in upon me
and it was very bad day in which failed to take pounds

as grew richer grew more ambitious took house in the
country and eventually married without anyone having
suspicion as to my real occupation my dear wife knew that had
business in the city she little knew what

last monday had finished for the day and was dressing in my
room above the opium den when looked out of my window and saw
to my horror and astonishment that my wife was standing in the
street with her eyes fixed full upon me gave cry of
surprise threw up my arms to cover my face and rushing to my
confidant the lascar entreated him to prevent anyone from
coming up to me heard her voice downstairs but knew that
she could not ascend swiftly threw off my clothes pulled on
those of beggar and put on my pigments and wig even wifes
eyes could not pierce so complete disguise but then it
occurred to me that there might be search in the room and that
the clothes might betray me threw open the window reopening
by my violence small cut which had inflicted upon myself in
the bedroom that morning then seized my coat which was
weighted by the coppers which had just transferred to it from
the leather bag in which carried my takings hurled it out of
the window and it disappeared into the thames the other clothes
would have followed but at that moment there was rush of
constables up the stair and few minutes after found rather
confess to my relief that instead of being identified as mr
neville st clair was arrested as his murderer

do not know that there is anything else for me to explain
was determined to preserve my disguise as long as possible and
hence my preference for dirty face knowing that my wife would
be terribly anxious slipped off my ring and confided it to the
lascar at moment when no constable was watching me together
with hurried scrawl telling her that she had no cause to
fear

that note only reached her yesterday said holmes

good god what week she must have spent

the police have watched this lascar said inspector bradstreet
and can quite understand that he might find it difficult to
post letter unobserved probably he handed it to some sailor
customer of his who forgot all about it for some days

that was it said holmes nodding approvingly have no doubt
of it but have you never been prosecuted for begging

many times but what was fine to me

it must stop here however said bradstreet if the police are
to hush this thing up there must be no more of hugh boone

have sworn it by the most solemn oaths which man can take

in that case think that it is probable that no further steps
may be taken but if you are found again then all must come out
am sure mr holmes that we are very much indebted to you for
having cleared the matter up wish knew how you reach your
results

reached this one said my friend by sitting upon five
pillows and consuming an ounce of shag think watson that if
we drive to baker street we shall just be in time for breakfast



vii the adventure of the blue carbuncle

had called upon my friend sherlock holmes upon the second
morning after christmas with the intention of wishing him the
compliments of the season he was lounging upon the sofa in
purple dressinggown piperack within his reach upon the
right and pile of crumpled morning papers evidently newly
studied near at hand beside the couch was wooden chair and
on the angle of the back hung very seedy and disreputable
hardfelt hat much the worse for wear and cracked in several
places lens and forceps lying upon the seat of the chair
suggested that the hat had been suspended in this manner for the
purpose of examination

you are engaged said perhaps interrupt you

not at all am glad to have friend with whom can discuss
my results the matter is perfectly trivial onehe jerked his
thumb in the direction of the old hatbut there are points in
connection with it which are not entirely devoid of interest and
even of instruction

seated myself in his armchair and warmed my hands before his
crackling fire for sharp frost had set in and the windows
were thick with the ice crystals suppose remarked that
homely as it looks this thing has some deadly story linked on to
itthat it is the clue which will guide you in the solution of
some mystery and the punishment of some crime

no no no crime said sherlock holmes laughing only one of
those whimsical little incidents which will happen when you have
four million human beings all jostling each other within the
space of few square miles amid the action and reaction of so
dense swarm of humanity every possible combination of events
may be expected to take place and many little problem will be
presented which may be striking and bizarre without being
criminal we have already had experience of such

so much so remarked that of the last six cases which
have added to my notes three have been entirely free of any
legal crime

precisely you allude to my attempt to recover the irene adler
papers to the singular case of miss mary sutherland and to the
adventure of the man with the twisted lip well have no doubt
that this small matter will fall into the same innocent category
you know peterson the commissionaire

yes

it is to him that this trophy belongs

it is his hat

no no he found it its owner is unknown beg that you will
look upon it not as battered billycock but as an intellectual
problem and first as to how it came here it arrived upon
christmas morning in company with good fat goose which is
have no doubt roasting at this moment in front of petersons
fire the facts are these about four oclock on christmas
morning peterson who as you know is very honest fellow was
returning from some small jollification and was making his way
homeward down tottenham court road in front of him he saw in
the gaslight tallish man walking with slight stagger and
carrying white goose slung over his shoulder as he reached the
corner of goodge street row broke out between this stranger
and little knot of roughs one of the latter knocked off the
mans hat on which he raised his stick to defend himself and
swinging it over his head smashed the shop window behind him
peterson had rushed forward to protect the stranger from his
assailants but the man shocked at having broken the window and
seeing an officiallooking person in uniform rushing towards him
dropped his goose took to his heels and vanished amid the
labyrinth of small streets which lie at the back of tottenham
court road the roughs had also fled at the appearance of
peterson so that he was left in possession of the field of
battle and also of the spoils of victory in the shape of this
battered hat and most unimpeachable christmas goose

which surely he restored to their owner

my dear fellow there lies the problem it is true that for
mrs henry baker was printed upon small card which was tied to
the birds left leg and it is also true that the initials
are legible upon the lining of this hat but as there are
some thousands of bakers and some hundreds of henry bakers in
this city of ours it is not easy to restore lost property to any
one of them

what then did peterson do

he brought round both hat and goose to me on christmas morning
knowing that even the smallest problems are of interest to me
the goose we retained until this morning when there were signs
that in spite of the slight frost it would be well that it
should be eaten without unnecessary delay its finder has carried
it off therefore to fulfil the ultimate destiny of goose
while continue to retain the hat of the unknown gentleman who
lost his christmas dinner

did he not advertise

no

then what clue could you have as to his identity

only as much as we can deduce

from his hat

precisely

but you are joking what can you gather from this old battered
felt

here is my lens you know my methods what can you gather
yourself as to the individuality of the man who has worn this
article

took the tattered object in my hands and turned it over rather
ruefully it was very ordinary black hat of the usual round
shape hard and much the worse for wear the lining had been of
red silk but was good deal discoloured there was no makers
name but as holmes had remarked the initials were
scrawled upon one side it was pierced in the brim for
hatsecurer but the elastic was missing for the rest it was
cracked exceedingly dusty and spotted in several places
although there seemed to have been some attempt to hide the
discoloured patches by smearing them with ink

can see nothing said handing it back to my friend

on the contrary watson you can see everything you fail
however to reason from what you see you are too timid in
drawing your inferences

then pray tell me what it is that you can infer from this hat

he picked it up and gazed at it in the peculiar introspective
fashion which was characteristic of him it is perhaps less
suggestive than it might have been he remarked and yet there
are few inferences which are very distinct and few others
which represent at least strong balance of probability that
the man was highly intellectual is of course obvious upon the
face of it and also that he was fairly welltodo within the
last three years although he has now fallen upon evil days he
had foresight but has less now than formerly pointing to
moral retrogression which when taken with the decline of his
fortunes seems to indicate some evil influence probably drink
at work upon him this may account also for the obvious fact that
his wife has ceased to love him

my dear holmes

he has however retained some degree of selfrespect he
continued disregarding my remonstrance he is man who leads
sedentary life goes out little is out of training entirely is
middleaged has grizzled hair which he has had cut within the
last few days and which he anoints with limecream these are
the more patent facts which are to be deduced from his hat also
by the way that it is extremely improbable that he has gas laid
on in his house

you are certainly joking holmes

not in the least is it possible that even now when give you
these results you are unable to see how they are attained

have no doubt that am very stupid but must confess that
am unable to follow you for example how did you deduce that
this man was intellectual

for answer holmes clapped the hat upon his head it came right
over the forehead and settled upon the bridge of his nose it is
question of cubic capacity said he man with so large
brain must have something in it

the decline of his fortunes then

this hat is three years old these flat brims curled at the edge
came in then it is hat of the very best quality look at the
band of ribbed silk and the excellent lining if this man could
afford to buy so expensive hat three years ago and has had no
hat since then he has assuredly gone down in the world

well that is clear enough certainly but how about the
foresight and the moral retrogression

sherlock holmes laughed here is the foresight said he putting
his finger upon the little disc and loop of the hatsecurer
they are never sold upon hats if this man ordered one it is
sign of certain amount of foresight since he went out of his
way to take this precaution against the wind but since we see
that he has broken the elastic and has not troubled to replace
it it is obvious that he has less foresight now than formerly
which is distinct proof of weakening nature on the other
hand he has endeavoured to conceal some of these stains upon the
felt by daubing them with ink which is sign that he has not
entirely lost his selfrespect

your reasoning is certainly plausible

the further points that he is middleaged that his hair is
grizzled that it has been recently cut and that he uses
limecream are all to be gathered from close examination of the
lower part of the lining the lens discloses large number of
hairends clean cut by the scissors of the barber they all
appear to be adhesive and there is distinct odour of
limecream this dust you will observe is not the gritty grey
dust of the street but the fluffy brown dust of the house
showing that it has been hung up indoors most of the time while
the marks of moisture upon the inside are proof positive that the
wearer perspired very freely and could therefore hardly be in
the best of training

but his wifeyou said that she had ceased to love him

this hat has not been brushed for weeks when see you my dear
watson with weeks accumulation of dust upon your hat and
when your wife allows you to go out in such state shall fear
that you also have been unfortunate enough to lose your wifes
affection

but he might be bachelor

nay he was bringing home the goose as peaceoffering to his
wife remember the card upon the birds leg

you have an answer to everything but how on earth do you deduce
that the gas is not laid on in his house

one tallow stain or even two might come by chance but when
see no less than five think that there can be little doubt
that the individual must be brought into frequent contact with
burning tallowwalks upstairs at night probably with his hat in
one hand and guttering candle in the other anyhow he never
got tallowstains from gasjet are you satisfied

well it is very ingenious said laughing but since as
you said just now there has been no crime committed and no harm
done save the loss of goose all this seems to be rather
waste of energy

sherlock holmes had opened his mouth to reply when the door flew
open and peterson the commissionaire rushed into the apartment
with flushed cheeks and the face of man who is dazed with
astonishment

the goose mr holmes the goose sir he gasped

eh what of it then has it returned to life and flapped off
through the kitchen window holmes twisted himself round upon
the sofa to get fairer view of the mans excited face

see here sir see what my wife found in its crop he held out
his hand and displayed upon the centre of the palm brilliantly
scintillating blue stone rather smaller than bean in size but
of such purity and radiance that it twinkled like an electric
point in the dark hollow of his hand

sherlock holmes sat up with whistle by jove peterson said
he this is treasure trove indeed suppose you know what you
have got

diamond sir precious stone it cuts into glass as though
it were putty

its more than precious stone it is the precious stone

not the countess of morcars blue carbuncle ejaculated

precisely so ought to know its size and shape seeing that
have read the advertisement about it in the times every day
lately it is absolutely unique and its value can only be
conjectured but the reward offered of pounds is certainly
not within twentieth part of the market price

thousand pounds great lord of mercy the commissionaire
plumped down into chair and stared from one to the other of us

that is the reward and have reason to know that there are
sentimental considerations in the background which would induce
the countess to part with half her fortune if she could but
recover the gem

it was lost if remember aright at the hotel cosmopolitan
remarked

precisely so on december just five days ago john horner
plumber was accused of having abstracted it from the ladys
jewelcase the evidence against him was so strong that the case
has been referred to the assizes have some account of the
matter here believe he rummaged amid his newspapers
glancing over the dates until at last he smoothed one out
doubled it over and read the following paragraph

hotel cosmopolitan jewel robbery john horner plumber was
brought up upon the charge of having upon the inst
abstracted from the jewelcase of the countess of morcar the
valuable gem known as the blue carbuncle james ryder
upperattendant at the hotel gave his evidence to the effect
that he had shown horner up to the dressingroom of the countess
of morcar upon the day of the robbery in order that he might
solder the second bar of the grate which was loose he had
remained with horner some little time but had finally been
called away on returning he found that horner had disappeared
that the bureau had been forced open and that the small morocco
casket in which as it afterwards transpired the countess was
accustomed to keep her jewel was lying empty upon the
dressingtable ryder instantly gave the alarm and horner was
arrested the same evening but the stone could not be found
either upon his person or in his rooms catherine cusack maid to
the countess deposed to having heard ryders cry of dismay on
discovering the robbery and to having rushed into the room
where she found matters as described by the last witness
inspector bradstreet division gave evidence as to the arrest
of horner who struggled frantically and protested his innocence
in the strongest terms evidence of previous conviction for
robbery having been given against the prisoner the magistrate
refused to deal summarily with the offence but referred it to
the assizes horner who had shown signs of intense emotion
during the proceedings fainted away at the conclusion and was
carried out of court

hum so much for the policecourt said holmes thoughtfully
tossing aside the paper the question for us now to solve is the
sequence of events leading from rifled jewelcase at one end to
the crop of goose in tottenham court road at the other you
see watson our little deductions have suddenly assumed much
more important and less innocent aspect here is the stone the
stone came from the goose and the goose came from mr henry
baker the gentleman with the bad hat and all the other
characteristics with which have bored you so now we must set
ourselves very seriously to finding this gentleman and
ascertaining what part he has played in this little mystery to
do this we must try the simplest means first and these lie
undoubtedly in an advertisement in all the evening papers if
this fail shall have recourse to other methods

what will you say

give me pencil and that slip of paper now then found at
the corner of goodge street goose and black felt hat mr
henry baker can have the same by applying at this evening at
baker street that is clear and concise

very but will he see it

well he is sure to keep an eye on the papers since to poor
man the loss was heavy one he was clearly so scared by his
mischance in breaking the window and by the approach of peterson
that he thought of nothing but flight but since then he must
have bitterly regretted the impulse which caused him to drop his
bird then again the introduction of his name will cause him to
see it for everyone who knows him will direct his attention to
it here you are peterson run down to the advertising agency
and have this put in the evening papers

in which sir

oh in the globe star pall mall st jamess evening news
standard echo and any others that occur to you

very well sir and this stone

ah yes shall keep the stone thank you and say
peterson just buy goose on your way back and leave it here
with me for we must have one to give to this gentleman in place
of the one which your family is now devouring

when the commissionaire had gone holmes took up the stone and
held it against the light its bonny thing said he just
see how it glints and sparkles of course it is nucleus and
focus of crime every good stone is they are the devils pet
baits in the larger and older jewels every facet may stand for
bloody deed this stone is not yet twenty years old it was found
in the banks of the amoy river in southern china and is remarkable
in having every characteristic of the carbuncle save that it is
blue in shade instead of ruby red in spite of its youth it has
already sinister history there have been two murders
vitriolthrowing suicide and several robberies brought about
for the sake of this fortygrain weight of crystallised charcoal
who would think that so pretty toy would be purveyor to the
gallows and the prison ill lock it up in my strong box now and
drop line to the countess to say that we have it

do you think that this man horner is innocent

cannot tell

well then do you imagine that this other one henry baker had
anything to do with the matter

it is think much more likely that henry baker is an
absolutely innocent man who had no idea that the bird which he
was carrying was of considerably more value than if it were made
of solid gold that however shall determine by very simple
test if we have an answer to our advertisement

and you can do nothing until then

nothing

in that case shall continue my professional round but shall
come back in the evening at the hour you have mentioned for
should like to see the solution of so tangled business

very glad to see you dine at seven there is woodcock
believe by the way in view of recent occurrences perhaps
ought to ask mrs hudson to examine its crop

had been delayed at case and it was little after halfpast
six when found myself in baker street once more as
approached the house saw tall man in scotch bonnet with
coat which was buttoned up to his chin waiting outside in the
bright semicircle which was thrown from the fanlight just as
arrived the door was opened and we were shown up together to
holmes room

mr henry baker believe said he rising from his armchair
and greeting his visitor with the easy air of geniality which he
could so readily assume pray take this chair by the fire mr
baker it is cold night and observe that your circulation is
more adapted for summer than for winter ah watson you have
just come at the right time is that your hat mr baker

yes sir that is undoubtedly my hat

he was large man with rounded shoulders massive head and
broad intelligent face sloping down to pointed beard of
grizzled brown touch of red in nose and cheeks with slight
tremor of his extended hand recalled holmes surmise as to his
habits his rusty black frockcoat was buttoned right up in
front with the collar turned up and his lank wrists protruded
from his sleeves without sign of cuff or shirt he spoke in
slow staccato fashion choosing his words with care and gave the
impression generally of man of learning and letters who had had
illusage at the hands of fortune

we have retained these things for some days said holmes
because we expected to see an advertisement from you giving your
address am at loss to know now why you did not advertise

our visitor gave rather shamefaced laugh shillings have not
been so plentiful with me as they once were he remarked had
no doubt that the gang of roughs who assaulted me had carried off
both my hat and the bird did not care to spend more money in
hopeless attempt at recovering them

very naturally by the way about the bird we were compelled to
eat it

to eat it our visitor half rose from his chair in his
excitement

yes it would have been of no use to anyone had we not done so
but presume that this other goose upon the sideboard which is
about the same weight and perfectly fresh will answer your
purpose equally well

oh certainly certainly answered mr baker with sigh of
relief

of course we still have the feathers legs crop and so on of
your own bird so if you wish

the man burst into hearty laugh they might be useful to me as
relics of my adventure said he but beyond that can hardly
see what use the disjecta membra of my late acquaintance are
going to be to me no sir think that with your permission
will confine my attentions to the excellent bird which perceive
upon the sideboard

sherlock holmes glanced sharply across at me with slight shrug
of his shoulders

there is your hat then and there your bird said he by the
way would it bore you to tell me where you got the other one
from am somewhat of fowl fancier and have seldom seen
better grown goose

certainly sir said baker who had risen and tucked his newly
gained property under his arm there are few of us who
frequent the alpha inn near the museumwe are to be found in
the museum itself during the day you understand this year our
good host windigate by name instituted goose club by which
on consideration of some few pence every week we were each to
receive bird at christmas my pence were duly paid and the
rest is familiar to you am much indebted to you sir for
scotch bonnet is fitted neither to my years nor my gravity with
comical pomposity of manner he bowed solemnly to both of us and
strode off upon his way

so much for mr henry baker said holmes when he had closed the
door behind him it is quite certain that he knows nothing
whatever about the matter are you hungry watson

not particularly

then suggest that we turn our dinner into supper and follow
up this clue while it is still hot

by all means

it was bitter night so we drew on our ulsters and wrapped
cravats about our throats outside the stars were shining coldly
in cloudless sky and the breath of the passersby blew out
into smoke like so many pistol shots our footfalls rang out
crisply and loudly as we swung through the doctors quarter
wimpole street harley street and so through wigmore street into
oxford street in quarter of an hour we were in bloomsbury at
the alpha inn which is small publichouse at the corner of one
of the streets which runs down into holborn holmes pushed open
the door of the private bar and ordered two glasses of beer from
the ruddyfaced whiteaproned landlord

your beer should be excellent if it is as good as your geese
said he

my geese the man seemed surprised

yes was speaking only half an hour ago to mr henry baker
who was member of your goose club

ah yes see but you see sir thems not our geese

indeed whose then

well got the two dozen from salesman in covent garden

indeed know some of them which was it

breckinridge is his name

ah dont know him well heres your good health landlord
and prosperity to your house goodnight

now for mr breckinridge he continued buttoning up his coat
as we came out into the frosty air remember watson that though
we have so homely thing as goose at one end of this chain we
have at the other man who will certainly get seven years penal
servitude unless we can establish his innocence it is possible
that our inquiry may but confirm his guilt but in any case we
have line of investigation which has been missed by the police
and which singular chance has placed in our hands let us
follow it out to the bitter end faces to the south then and
quick march

we passed across holborn down endell street and so through
zigzag of slums to covent garden market one of the largest
stalls bore the name of breckinridge upon it and the proprietor
horseylooking man with sharp face and trim sidewhiskers was
helping boy to put up the shutters

goodevening its cold night said holmes

the salesman nodded and shot questioning glance at my
companion

sold out of geese see continued holmes pointing at the
bare slabs of marble

let you have five hundred tomorrow morning

thats no good

well there are some on the stall with the gasflare

ah but was recommended to you

who by

the landlord of the alpha

oh yes sent him couple of dozen

fine birds they were too now where did you get them from

to my surprise the question provoked burst of anger from the
salesman

now then mister said he with his head cocked and his arms
akimbo what are you driving at lets have it straight now

it is straight enough should like to know who sold you the
geese which you supplied to the alpha

well then shant tell you so now

oh it is matter of no importance but dont know why you
should be so warm over such trifle

warm youd be as warm maybe if you were as pestered as am
when pay good money for good article there should be an end
of the business but its where are the geese and who did you
sell the geese to and what will you take for the geese one
would think they were the only geese in the world to hear the
fuss that is made over them

well have no connection with any other people who have been
making inquiries said holmes carelessly if you wont tell us
the bet is off that is all but im always ready to back my
opinion on matter of fowls and have fiver on it that the
bird ate is country bred

well then youve lost your fiver for its town bred snapped
the salesman

its nothing of the kind

say it is

dont believe it

dyou think you know more about fowls than who have handled
them ever since was nipper tell you all those birds that
went to the alpha were town bred

youll never persuade me to believe that

will you bet then

its merely taking your money for know that am right but
ill have sovereign on with you just to teach you not to be
obstinate

the salesman chuckled grimly bring me the books bill said
he

the small boy brought round small thin volume and great
greasybacked one laying them out together beneath the hanging
lamp

now then mr cocksure said the salesman thought that
was out of geese but before finish youll find that there is
still one left in my shop you see this little book

well

thats the list of the folk from whom buy dyou see well
then here on this page are the country folk and the numbers
after their names are where their accounts are in the big ledger
now then you see this other page in red ink well that is
list of my town suppliers now look at that third name just
read it out to me

mrs oakshott brixton read holmes

quite so now turn that up in the ledger

holmes turned to the page indicated here you are mrs
oakshott brixton road egg and poultry supplier

now then whats the last entry

december twentyfour geese at

quite so there you are and underneath

sold to mr windigate of the alpha at

what have you to say now

sherlock holmes looked deeply chagrined he drew sovereign from
his pocket and threw it down upon the slab turning away with the
air of man whose disgust is too deep for words few yards off
he stopped under lamppost and laughed in the hearty noiseless
fashion which was peculiar to him

when you see man with whiskers of that cut and the pink un
protruding out of his pocket you can always draw him by bet
said he daresay that if had put pounds down in front of
him that man would not have given me such complete information
as was drawn from him by the idea that he was doing me on
wager well watson we are fancy nearing the end of our
quest and the only point which remains to be determined is
whether we should go on to this mrs oakshott tonight or
whether we should reserve it for tomorrow it is clear from what
that surly fellow said that there are others besides ourselves
who are anxious about the matter and should

his remarks were suddenly cut short by loud hubbub which broke
out from the stall which we had just left turning round we saw
little ratfaced fellow standing in the centre of the circle of
yellow light which was thrown by the swinging lamp while
breckinridge the salesman framed in the door of his stall was
shaking his fists fiercely at the cringing figure

ive had enough of you and your geese he shouted wish you
were all at the devil together if you come pestering me any more
with your silly talk ill set the dog at you you bring mrs
oakshott here and ill answer her but what have you to do with
it did buy the geese off you

no but one of them was mine all the same whined the little
man

well then ask mrs oakshott for it

she told me to ask you

well you can ask the king of proosia for all care ive had
enough of it get out of this he rushed fiercely forward and
the inquirer flitted away into the darkness

ha this may save us visit to brixton road whispered holmes
come with me and we will see what is to be made of this
fellow striding through the scattered knots of people who
lounged round the flaring stalls my companion speedily overtook
the little man and touched him upon the shoulder he sprang
round and could see in the gaslight that every vestige of
colour had been driven from his face

who are you then what do you want he asked in quavering
voice

you will excuse me said holmes blandly but could not help
overhearing the questions which you put to the salesman just now
think that could be of assistance to you

you who are you how could you know anything of the matter

my name is sherlock holmes it is my business to know what other
people dont know

but you can know nothing of this

excuse me know everything of it you are endeavouring to
trace some geese which were sold by mrs oakshott of brixton
road to salesman named breckinridge by him in turn to mr
windigate of the alpha and by him to his club of which mr
henry baker is member

oh sir you are the very man whom have longed to meet cried
the little fellow with outstretched hands and quivering fingers
can hardly explain to you how interested am in this matter

sherlock holmes hailed fourwheeler which was passing in that
case we had better discuss it in cosy room rather than in this
windswept marketplace said he but pray tell me before we
go farther who it is that have the pleasure of assisting

the man hesitated for an instant my name is john robinson he
answered with sidelong glance

no no the real name said holmes sweetly it is always
awkward doing business with an alias

flush sprang to the white cheeks of the stranger well then
said he my real name is james ryder

precisely so head attendant at the hotel cosmopolitan pray
step into the cab and shall soon be able to tell you
everything which you would wish to know

the little man stood glancing from one to the other of us with
halffrightened halfhopeful eyes as one who is not sure
whether he is on the verge of windfall or of catastrophe
then he stepped into the cab and in half an hour we were back in
the sittingroom at baker street nothing had been said during
our drive but the high thin breathing of our new companion and
the claspings and unclaspings of his hands spoke of the nervous
tension within him

here we are said holmes cheerily as we filed into the room
the fire looks very seasonable in this weather you look cold
mr ryder pray take the basketchair will just put on my
slippers before we settle this little matter of yours now then
you want to know what became of those geese

yes sir

or rather fancy of that goose it was one bird imagine in
which you were interestedwhite with black bar across the
tail

ryder quivered with emotion oh sir he cried can you tell
me where it went to

it came here

here

yes and most remarkable bird it proved dont wonder that
you should take an interest in it it laid an egg after it was
deadthe bonniest brightest little blue egg that ever was seen
have it here in my museum

our visitor staggered to his feet and clutched the mantelpiece
with his right hand holmes unlocked his strongbox and held up
the blue carbuncle which shone out like star with cold
brilliant manypointed radiance ryder stood glaring with
drawn face uncertain whether to claim or to disown it

the games up ryder said holmes quietly hold up man or
youll be into the fire give him an arm back into his chair
watson hes not got blood enough to go in for felony with
impunity give him dash of brandy so now he looks little
more human what shrimp it is to be sure

for moment he had staggered and nearly fallen but the brandy
brought tinge of colour into his cheeks and he sat staring
with frightened eyes at his accuser

have almost every link in my hands and all the proofs which
could possibly need so there is little which you need tell me
still that little may as well be cleared up to make the case
complete you had heard ryder of this blue stone of the
countess of morcars

it was catherine cusack who told me of it said he in
crackling voice

seeher ladyships waitingmaid well the temptation of
sudden wealth so easily acquired was too much for you as it has
been for better men before you but you were not very scrupulous
in the means you used it seems to me ryder that there is the
making of very pretty villain in you you knew that this man
horner the plumber had been concerned in some such matter
before and that suspicion would rest the more readily upon him
what did you do then you made some small job in my ladys
roomyou and your confederate cusackand you managed that he
should be the man sent for then when he had left you rifled
the jewelcase raised the alarm and had this unfortunate man
arrested you then

ryder threw himself down suddenly upon the rug and clutched at my
companions knees for gods sake have mercy he shrieked
think of my father of my mother it would break their hearts
never went wrong before never will again swear it ill
swear it on bible oh dont bring it into court for christs
sake dont

get back into your chair said holmes sternly it is very well
to cringe and crawl now but you thought little enough of this
poor horner in the dock for crime of which he knew nothing

will fly mr holmes will leave the country sir then the
charge against him will break down

hum we will talk about that and now let us hear true account
of the next act how came the stone into the goose and how came
the goose into the open market tell us the truth for there lies
your only hope of safety

ryder passed his tongue over his parched lips will tell you
it just as it happened sir said he when horner had been
arrested it seemed to me that it would be best for me to get
away with the stone at once for did not know at what moment
the police might not take it into their heads to search me and my
room there was no place about the hotel where it would be safe
went out as if on some commission and made for my sisters
house she had married man named oakshott and lived in brixton
road where she fattened fowls for the market all the way there
every man met seemed to me to be policeman or detective
and for all that it was cold night the sweat was pouring down
my face before came to the brixton road my sister asked me
what was the matter and why was so pale but told her that
had been upset by the jewel robbery at the hotel then went
into the back yard and smoked pipe and wondered what it would
be best to do

had friend once called maudsley who went to the bad and
has just been serving his time in pentonville one day he had met
me and fell into talk about the ways of thieves and how they
could get rid of what they stole knew that he would be true to
me for knew one or two things about him so made up my mind
to go right on to kilburn where he lived and take him into my
confidence he would show me how to turn the stone into money
but how to get to him in safety thought of the agonies had
gone through in coming from the hotel might at any moment be
seized and searched and there would be the stone in my waistcoat
pocket was leaning against the wall at the time and looking at
the geese which were waddling about round my feet and suddenly
an idea came into my head which showed me how could beat the
best detective that ever lived

my sister had told me some weeks before that might have the
pick of her geese for christmas present and knew that she
was always as good as her word would take my goose now and in
it would carry my stone to kilburn there was little shed in
the yard and behind this drove one of the birdsa fine big
one white with barred tail caught it and prying its bill
open thrust the stone down its throat as far as my finger
could reach the bird gave gulp and felt the stone pass
along its gullet and down into its crop but the creature flapped
and struggled and out came my sister to know what was the
matter as turned to speak to her the brute broke loose and
fluttered off among the others

whatever were you doing with that bird jem says she

well said you said youd give me one for christmas and
was feeling which was the fattest

oh says she weve set yours aside for youjems bird we
call it its the big white one over yonder theres twentysix
of them which makes one for you and one for us and two dozen
for the market

thank you maggie says but if it is all the same to you
id rather have that one was handling just now

the other is good three pound heavier said she and we
fattened it expressly for you

never mind ill have the other and ill take it now said

oh just as you like said she little huffed which is it
you want then

that white one with the barred tail right in the middle of the
flock

oh very well kill it and take it with you

well did what she said mr holmes and carried the bird
all the way to kilburn told my pal what had done for he was
man that it was easy to tell thing like that to he laughed
until he choked and we got knife and opened the goose my
heart turned to water for there was no sign of the stone and
knew that some terrible mistake had occurred left the bird
rushed back to my sisters and hurried into the back yard there
was not bird to be seen there

where are they all maggie cried

gone to the dealers jem

which dealers

breckinridge of covent garden

but was there another with barred tail asked the same
as the one chose

yes jem there were two barredtailed ones and could never
tell them apart

well then of course saw it all and ran off as hard as my
feet would carry me to this man breckinridge but he had sold the
lot at once and not one word would he tell me as to where they
had gone you heard him yourselves tonight well he has always
answered me like that my sister thinks that am going mad
sometimes think that am myself and nowand now am myself
branded thief without ever having touched the wealth for which
sold my character god help me god help me he burst into
convulsive sobbing with his face buried in his hands

there was long silence broken only by his heavy breathing and
by the measured tapping of sherlock holmes fingertips upon the
edge of the table then my friend rose and threw open the door

get out said he

what sir oh heaven bless you

no more words get out

and no more words were needed there was rush clatter upon
the stairs the bang of door and the crisp rattle of running
footfalls from the street

after all watson said holmes reaching up his hand for his
clay pipe am not retained by the police to supply their
deficiencies if horner were in danger it would be another thing
but this fellow will not appear against him and the case must
collapse suppose that am commuting felony but it is just
possible that am saving soul this fellow will not go wrong
again he is too terribly frightened send him to gaol now and
you make him gaolbird for life besides it is the season of
forgiveness chance has put in our way most singular and
whimsical problem and its solution is its own reward if you
will have the goodness to touch the bell doctor we will begin
another investigation in which also bird will be the chief
feature



viii the adventure of the speckled band

on glancing over my notes of the seventy odd cases in which
have during the last eight years studied the methods of my friend
sherlock holmes find many tragic some comic large number
merely strange but none commonplace for working as he did
rather for the love of his art than for the acquirement of
wealth he refused to associate himself with any investigation
which did not tend towards the unusual and even the fantastic
of all these varied cases however cannot recall any which
presented more singular features than that which was associated
with the wellknown surrey family of the roylotts of stoke moran
the events in question occurred in the early days of my
association with holmes when we were sharing rooms as bachelors
in baker street it is possible that might have placed them
upon record before but promise of secrecy was made at the
time from which have only been freed during the last month by
the untimely death of the lady to whom the pledge was given it
is perhaps as well that the facts should now come to light for
have reasons to know that there are widespread rumours as to the
death of dr grimesby roylott which tend to make the matter even
more terrible than the truth

it was early in april in the year that woke one morning to
find sherlock holmes standing fully dressed by the side of my
bed he was late riser as rule and as the clock on the
mantelpiece showed me that it was only quarterpast seven
blinked up at him in some surprise and perhaps just little
resentment for was myself regular in my habits

very sorry to knock you up watson said he but its the
common lot this morning mrs hudson has been knocked up she
retorted upon me and on you

what is it thena fire

no client it seems that young lady has arrived in
considerable state of excitement who insists upon seeing me she
is waiting now in the sittingroom now when young ladies wander
about the metropolis at this hour of the morning and knock
sleepy people up out of their beds presume that it is
something very pressing which they have to communicate should it
prove to be an interesting case you would am sure wish to
follow it from the outset thought at any rate that should
call you and give you the chance

my dear fellow would not miss it for anything

had no keener pleasure than in following holmes in his
professional investigations and in admiring the rapid
deductions as swift as intuitions and yet always founded on
logical basis with which he unravelled the problems which were
submitted to him rapidly threw on my clothes and was ready in
few minutes to accompany my friend down to the sittingroom
lady dressed in black and heavily veiled who had been sitting in
the window rose as we entered

goodmorning madam said holmes cheerily my name is sherlock
holmes this is my intimate friend and associate dr watson
before whom you can speak as freely as before myself ha am
glad to see that mrs hudson has had the good sense to light the
fire pray draw up to it and shall order you cup of hot
coffee for observe that you are shivering

it is not cold which makes me shiver said the woman in low
voice changing her seat as requested

what then

it is fear mr holmes it is terror she raised her veil as
she spoke and we could see that she was indeed in pitiable
state of agitation her face all drawn and grey with restless
frightened eyes like those of some hunted animal her features
and figure were those of woman of thirty but her hair was shot
with premature grey and her expression was weary and haggard
sherlock holmes ran her over with one of his quick
allcomprehensive glances

you must not fear said he soothingly bending forward and
patting her forearm we shall soon set matters right have no
doubt you have come in by train this morning see

you know me then

no but observe the second half of return ticket in the palm
of your left glove you must have started early and yet you had
good drive in dogcart along heavy roads before you reached
the station

the lady gave violent start and stared in bewilderment at my
companion

there is no mystery my dear madam said he smiling the left
arm of your jacket is spattered with mud in no less than seven
places the marks are perfectly fresh there is no vehicle save
dogcart which throws up mud in that way and then only when you
sit on the lefthand side of the driver

whatever your reasons may be you are perfectly correct said
she started from home before six reached leatherhead at
twenty past and came in by the first train to waterloo sir
can stand this strain no longer shall go mad if it continues
have no one to turn tonone save only one who cares for me
and he poor fellow can be of little aid have heard of you
mr holmes have heard of you from mrs farintosh whom you
helped in the hour of her sore need it was from her that had
your address oh sir do you not think that you could help me
too and at least throw little light through the dense darkness
which surrounds me at present it is out of my power to reward
you for your services but in month or six weeks shall be
married with the control of my own income and then at least you
shall not find me ungrateful

holmes turned to his desk and unlocking it drew out small
casebook which he consulted

farintosh said he ah yes recall the case it was
concerned with an opal tiara think it was before your time
watson can only say madam that shall be happy to devote
the same care to your case as did to that of your friend as to
reward my profession is its own reward but you are at liberty
to defray whatever expenses may be put to at the time which
suits you best and now beg that you will lay before us
everything that may help us in forming an opinion upon the
matter

alas replied our visitor the very horror of my situation
lies in the fact that my fears are so vague and my suspicions
depend so entirely upon small points which might seem trivial to
another that even he to whom of all others have right to
look for help and advice looks upon all that tell him about it
as the fancies of nervous woman he does not say so but can
read it from his soothing answers and averted eyes but have
heard mr holmes that you can see deeply into the manifold
wickedness of the human heart you may advise me how to walk amid
the dangers which encompass me

am all attention madam

my name is helen stoner and am living with my stepfather who
is the last survivor of one of the oldest saxon families in
england the roylotts of stoke moran on the western border of
surrey

holmes nodded his head the name is familiar to me said he

the family was at one time among the richest in england and the
estates extended over the borders into berkshire in the north
and hampshire in the west in the last century however four
successive heirs were of dissolute and wasteful disposition
and the family ruin was eventually completed by gambler in the
days of the regency nothing was left save few acres of ground
and the twohundredyearold house which is itself crushed under
heavy mortgage the last squire dragged out his existence
there living the horrible life of an aristocratic pauper but
his only son my stepfather seeing that he must adapt himself to
the new conditions obtained an advance from relative which
enabled him to take medical degree and went out to calcutta
where by his professional skill and his force of character he
established large practice in fit of anger however caused
by some robberies which had been perpetrated in the house he
beat his native butler to death and narrowly escaped capital
sentence as it was he suffered long term of imprisonment and
afterwards returned to england morose and disappointed man

when dr roylott was in india he married my mother mrs stoner
the young widow of majorgeneral stoner of the bengal artillery
my sister julia and were twins and we were only two years old
at the time of my mothers remarriage she had considerable
sum of moneynot less than pounds yearand this she
bequeathed to dr roylott entirely while we resided with him
with provision that certain annual sum should be allowed to
each of us in the event of our marriage shortly after our return
to england my mother diedshe was killed eight years ago in
railway accident near crewe dr roylott then abandoned his
attempts to establish himself in practice in london and took us
to live with him in the old ancestral house at stoke moran the
money which my mother had left was enough for all our wants and
there seemed to be no obstacle to our happiness

but terrible change came over our stepfather about this time
instead of making friends and exchanging visits with our
neighbours who had at first been overjoyed to see roylott of
stoke moran back in the old family seat he shut himself up in
his house and seldom came out save to indulge in ferocious
quarrels with whoever might cross his path violence of temper
approaching to mania has been hereditary in the men of the
family and in my stepfathers case it had believe been
intensified by his long residence in the tropics series of
disgraceful brawls took place two of which ended in the
policecourt until at last he became the terror of the village
and the folks would fly at his approach for he is man of
immense strength and absolutely uncontrollable in his anger

last week he hurled the local blacksmith over parapet into
stream and it was only by paying over all the money which
could gather together that was able to avert another public
exposure he had no friends at all save the wandering gipsies
and he would give these vagabonds leave to encamp upon the few
acres of bramblecovered land which represent the family estate
and would accept in return the hospitality of their tents
wandering away with them sometimes for weeks on end he has
passion also for indian animals which are sent over to him by
correspondent and he has at this moment cheetah and baboon
which wander freely over his grounds and are feared by the
villagers almost as much as their master

you can imagine from what say that my poor sister julia and
had no great pleasure in our lives no servant would stay with
us and for long time we did all the work of the house she was
but thirty at the time of her death and yet her hair had already
begun to whiten even as mine has

your sister is dead then

she died just two years ago and it is of her death that wish
to speak to you you can understand that living the life which
have described we were little likely to see anyone of our own
age and position we had however an aunt my mothers maiden
sister miss honoria westphail who lives near harrow and we
were occasionally allowed to pay short visits at this ladys
house julia went there at christmas two years ago and met there
halfpay major of marines to whom she became engaged my
stepfather learned of the engagement when my sister returned and
offered no objection to the marriage but within fortnight of
the day which had been fixed for the wedding the terrible event
occurred which has deprived me of my only companion

sherlock holmes had been leaning back in his chair with his eyes
closed and his head sunk in cushion but he half opened his
lids now and glanced across at his visitor

pray be precise as to details said he

it is easy for me to be so for every event of that dreadful
time is seared into my memory the manorhouse is as have
already said very old and only one wing is now inhabited the
bedrooms in this wing are on the ground floor the sittingrooms
being in the central block of the buildings of these bedrooms
the first is dr roylotts the second my sisters and the third
my own there is no communication between them but they all open
out into the same corridor do make myself plain

perfectly so

the windows of the three rooms open out upon the lawn that
fatal night dr roylott had gone to his room early though we
knew that he had not retired to rest for my sister was troubled
by the smell of the strong indian cigars which it was his custom
to smoke she left her room therefore and came into mine where
she sat for some time chatting about her approaching wedding at
eleven oclock she rose to leave me but she paused at the door
and looked back

tell me helen said she have you ever heard anyone whistle
in the dead of the night

never said

suppose that you could not possibly whistle yourself in
your sleep

certainly not but why

because during the last few nights have always about three
in the morning heard low clear whistle am light sleeper
and it has awakened me cannot tell where it came fromperhaps
from the next room perhaps from the lawn thought that would
just ask you whether you had heard it

no have not it must be those wretched gipsies in the
plantation

very likely and yet if it were on the lawn wonder that you
did not hear it also

ah but sleep more heavily than you

well it is of no great consequence at any rate she smiled
back at me closed my door and few moments later heard her
key turn in the lock

indeed said holmes was it your custom always to lock
yourselves in at night

always

and why

think that mentioned to you that the doctor kept cheetah
and baboon we had no feeling of security unless our doors were
locked

quite so pray proceed with your statement

could not sleep that night vague feeling of impending
misfortune impressed me my sister and you will recollect
were twins and you know how subtle are the links which bind two
souls which are so closely allied it was wild night the wind
was howling outside and the rain was beating and splashing
against the windows suddenly amid all the hubbub of the gale
there burst forth the wild scream of terrified woman knew
that it was my sisters voice sprang from my bed wrapped
shawl round me and rushed into the corridor as opened my door
seemed to hear low whistle such as my sister described and
few moments later clanging sound as if mass of metal had
fallen as ran down the passage my sisters door was unlocked
and revolved slowly upon its hinges stared at it
horrorstricken not knowing what was about to issue from it by
the light of the corridorlamp saw my sister appear at the
opening her face blanched with terror her hands groping for
help her whole figure swaying to and fro like that of
drunkard ran to her and threw my arms round her but at that
moment her knees seemed to give way and she fell to the ground
she writhed as one who is in terrible pain and her limbs were
dreadfully convulsed at first thought that she had not
recognised me but as bent over her she suddenly shrieked out
in voice which shall never forget oh my god helen it was
the band the speckled band there was something else which she
would fain have said and she stabbed with her finger into the
air in the direction of the doctors room but fresh convulsion
seized her and choked her words rushed out calling loudly for
my stepfather and met him hastening from his room in his
dressinggown when he reached my sisters side she was
unconscious and though he poured brandy down her throat and sent
for medical aid from the village all efforts were in vain for
she slowly sank and died without having recovered her
consciousness such was the dreadful end of my beloved sister

one moment said holmes are you sure about this whistle and
metallic sound could you swear to it

that was what the county coroner asked me at the inquiry it is
my strong impression that heard it and yet among the crash of
the gale and the creaking of an old house may possibly have
been deceived

was your sister dressed

no she was in her nightdress in her right hand was found the
charred stump of match and in her left matchbox

showing that she had struck light and looked about her when
the alarm took place that is important and what conclusions did
the coroner come to

he investigated the case with great care for dr roylotts
conduct had long been notorious in the county but he was unable
to find any satisfactory cause of death my evidence showed that
the door had been fastened upon the inner side and the windows
were blocked by oldfashioned shutters with broad iron bars
which were secured every night the walls were carefully sounded
and were shown to be quite solid all round and the flooring was
also thoroughly examined with the same result the chimney is
wide but is barred up by four large staples it is certain
therefore that my sister was quite alone when she met her end
besides there were no marks of any violence upon her

how about poison

the doctors examined her for it but without success

what do you think that this unfortunate lady died of then

it is my belief that she died of pure fear and nervous shock
though what it was that frightened her cannot imagine

were there gipsies in the plantation at the time

yes there are nearly always some there

ah and what did you gather from this allusion to banda
speckled band

sometimes have thought that it was merely the wild talk of
delirium sometimes that it may have referred to some band of
people perhaps to these very gipsies in the plantation do not
know whether the spotted handkerchiefs which so many of them wear
over their heads might have suggested the strange adjective which
she used

holmes shook his head like man who is far from being satisfied

these are very deep waters said he pray go on with your
narrative

two years have passed since then and my life has been until
lately lonelier than ever month ago however dear friend
whom have known for many years has done me the honour to ask
my hand in marriage his name is armitagepercy armitagethe
second son of mr armitage of crane water near reading my
stepfather has offered no opposition to the match and we are to
be married in the course of the spring two days ago some repairs
were started in the west wing of the building and my bedroom
wall has been pierced so that have had to move into the
chamber in which my sister died and to sleep in the very bed in
which she slept imagine then my thrill of terror when last
night as lay awake thinking over her terrible fate
suddenly heard in the silence of the night the low whistle which
had been the herald of her own death sprang up and lit the
lamp but nothing was to be seen in the room was too shaken to
go to bed again however so dressed and as soon as it was
daylight slipped down got dogcart at the crown inn which
is opposite and drove to leatherhead from whence have come on
this morning with the one object of seeing you and asking your
advice

you have done wisely said my friend but have you told me
all

yes all

miss roylott you have not you are screening your stepfather

why what do you mean

for answer holmes pushed back the frill of black lace which
fringed the hand that lay upon our visitors knee five little
livid spots the marks of four fingers and thumb were printed
upon the white wrist

you have been cruelly used said holmes

the lady coloured deeply and covered over her injured wrist he
is hard man she said and perhaps he hardly knows his own
strength

there was long silence during which holmes leaned his chin
upon his hands and stared into the crackling fire

this is very deep business he said at last there are
thousand details which should desire to know before decide
upon our course of action yet we have not moment to lose if
we were to come to stoke moran today would it be possible for
us to see over these rooms without the knowledge of your
stepfather

as it happens he spoke of coming into town today upon some
most important business it is probable that he will be away all
day and that there would be nothing to disturb you we have
housekeeper now but she is old and foolish and could easily
get her out of the way

excellent you are not averse to this trip watson

by no means

then we shall both come what are you going to do yourself

have one or two things which would wish to do now that am
in town but shall return by the twelve oclock train so as to
be there in time for your coming

and you may expect us early in the afternoon have myself some
small business matters to attend to will you not wait and
breakfast

no must go my heart is lightened already since have
confided my trouble to you shall look forward to seeing you
again this afternoon she dropped her thick black veil over her
face and glided from the room

and what do you think of it all watson asked sherlock holmes
leaning back in his chair

it seems to me to be most dark and sinister business

dark enough and sinister enough

yet if the lady is correct in saying that the flooring and walls
are sound and that the door window and chimney are impassable
then her sister must have been undoubtedly alone when she met her
mysterious end

what becomes then of these nocturnal whistles and what of the
very peculiar words of the dying woman

cannot think

when you combine the ideas of whistles at night the presence of
band of gipsies who are on intimate terms with this old doctor
the fact that we have every reason to believe that the doctor has
an interest in preventing his stepdaughters marriage the dying
allusion to band and finally the fact that miss helen stoner
heard metallic clang which might have been caused by one of
those metal bars that secured the shutters falling back into its
place think that there is good ground to think that the
mystery may be cleared along those lines

but what then did the gipsies do

cannot imagine

see many objections to any such theory

and so do it is precisely for that reason that we are going
to stoke moran this day want to see whether the objections are
fatal or if they may be explained away but what in the name of
the devil

the ejaculation had been drawn from my companion by the fact that
our door had been suddenly dashed open and that huge man had
framed himself in the aperture his costume was peculiar
mixture of the professional and of the agricultural having
black tophat long frockcoat and pair of high gaiters
with huntingcrop swinging in his hand so tall was he that his
hat actually brushed the cross bar of the doorway and his
breadth seemed to span it across from side to side large face
seared with thousand wrinkles burned yellow with the sun and
marked with every evil passion was turned from one to the other
of us while his deepset bileshot eyes and his high thin
fleshless nose gave him somewhat the resemblance to fierce old
bird of prey

which of you is holmes asked this apparition

my name sir but you have the advantage of me said my
companion quietly

am dr grimesby roylott of stoke moran

indeed doctor said holmes blandly pray take seat

will do nothing of the kind my stepdaughter has been here
have traced her what has she been saying to you

it is little cold for the time of the year said holmes

what has she been saying to you screamed the old man
furiously

but have heard that the crocuses promise well continued my
companion imperturbably

ha you put me off do you said our new visitor taking step
forward and shaking his huntingcrop know you you scoundrel
have heard of you before you are holmes the meddler

my friend smiled

holmes the busybody

his smile broadened

holmes the scotland yard jackinoffice

holmes chuckled heartily your conversation is most
entertaining said he when you go out close the door for
there is decided draught

will go when have said my say dont you dare to meddle with
my affairs know that miss stoner has been here traced her
am dangerous man to fall foul of see here he stepped
swiftly forward seized the poker and bent it into curve with
his huge brown hands

see that you keep yourself out of my grip he snarled and
hurling the twisted poker into the fireplace he strode out of the
room

he seems very amiable person said holmes laughing am
not quite so bulky but if he had remained might have shown him
that my grip was not much more feeble than his own as he spoke
he picked up the steel poker and with sudden effort
straightened it out again

fancy his having the insolence to confound me with the official
detective force this incident gives zest to our investigation
however and only trust that our little friend will not suffer
from her imprudence in allowing this brute to trace her and now
watson we shall order breakfast and afterwards shall walk
down to doctors commons where hope to get some data which may
help us in this matter


it was nearly one oclock when sherlock holmes returned from his
excursion he held in his hand sheet of blue paper scrawled
over with notes and figures

have seen the will of the deceased wife said he to
determine its exact meaning have been obliged to work out the
present prices of the investments with which it is concerned the
total income which at the time of the wifes death was little
short of pounds is now through the fall in agricultural
prices not more than pounds each daughter can claim an
income of pounds in case of marriage it is evident
therefore that if both girls had married this beauty would have
had mere pittance while even one of them would cripple him to
very serious extent my mornings work has not been wasted
since it has proved that he has the very strongest motives for
standing in the way of anything of the sort and now watson
this is too serious for dawdling especially as the old man is
aware that we are interesting ourselves in his affairs so if you
are ready we shall call cab and drive to waterloo should be
very much obliged if you would slip your revolver into your
pocket an eleys no is an excellent argument with gentlemen
who can twist steel pokers into knots that and toothbrush
are think all that we need

at waterloo we were fortunate in catching train for
leatherhead where we hired trap at the station inn and drove
for four or five miles through the lovely surrey lanes it was
perfect day with bright sun and few fleecy clouds in the
heavens the trees and wayside hedges were just throwing out
their first green shoots and the air was full of the pleasant
smell of the moist earth to me at least there was strange
contrast between the sweet promise of the spring and this
sinister quest upon which we were engaged my companion sat in
the front of the trap his arms folded his hat pulled down over
his eyes and his chin sunk upon his breast buried in the
deepest thought suddenly however he started tapped me on the
shoulder and pointed over the meadows

look there said he

heavily timbered park stretched up in gentle slope
thickening into grove at the highest point from amid the
branches there jutted out the grey gables and high rooftree of
very old mansion

stoke moran said he

yes sir that be the house of dr grimesby roylott remarked
the driver

there is some building going on there said holmes that is
where we are going

theres the village said the driver pointing to cluster of
roofs some distance to the left but if you want to get to the
house youll find it shorter to get over this stile and so by
the footpath over the fields there it is where the lady is
walking

and the lady fancy is miss stoner observed holmes shading
his eyes yes think we had better do as you suggest

we got off paid our fare and the trap rattled back on its way
to leatherhead

thought it as well said holmes as we climbed the stile
that this fellow should think we had come here as architects or
on some definite business it may stop his gossip
goodafternoon miss stoner you see that we have been as good as
our word

our client of the morning had hurried forward to meet us with
face which spoke her joy have been waiting so eagerly for
you she cried shaking hands with us warmly all has turned
out splendidly dr roylott has gone to town and it is unlikely
that he will be back before evening

we have had the pleasure of making the doctors acquaintance
said holmes and in few words he sketched out what had
occurred miss stoner turned white to the lips as she listened

good heavens she cried he has followed me then

so it appears

he is so cunning that never know when am safe from him what
will he say when he returns

he must guard himself for he may find that there is someone
more cunning than himself upon his track you must lock yourself
up from him tonight if he is violent we shall take you away to
your aunts at harrow now we must make the best use of our
time so kindly take us at once to the rooms which we are to
examine

the building was of grey lichenblotched stone with high
central portion and two curving wings like the claws of crab
thrown out on each side in one of these wings the windows were
broken and blocked with wooden boards while the roof was partly
caved in picture of ruin the central portion was in little
better repair but the righthand block was comparatively modern
and the blinds in the windows with the blue smoke curling up
from the chimneys showed that this was where the family resided
some scaffolding had been erected against the end wall and the
stonework had been broken into but there were no signs of any
workmen at the moment of our visit holmes walked slowly up and
down the illtrimmed lawn and examined with deep attention the
outsides of the windows

this take it belongs to the room in which you used to sleep
the centre one to your sisters and the one next to the main
building to dr roylotts chamber

exactly so but am now sleeping in the middle one

pending the alterations as understand by the way there does
not seem to be any very pressing need for repairs at that end
wall

there were none believe that it was an excuse to move me from
my room

ah that is suggestive now on the other side of this narrow
wing runs the corridor from which these three rooms open there
are windows in it of course

yes but very small ones too narrow for anyone to pass
through

as you both locked your doors at night your rooms were
unapproachable from that side now would you have the kindness
to go into your room and bar your shutters

miss stoner did so and holmes after careful examination
through the open window endeavoured in every way to force the
shutter open but without success there was no slit through
which knife could be passed to raise the bar then with his
lens he tested the hinges but they were of solid iron built
firmly into the massive masonry hum said he scratching his
chin in some perplexity my theory certainly presents some
difficulties no one could pass these shutters if they were
bolted well we shall see if the inside throws any light upon
the matter

small side door led into the whitewashed corridor from which
the three bedrooms opened holmes refused to examine the third
chamber so we passed at once to the second that in which miss
stoner was now sleeping and in which her sister had met with her
fate it was homely little room with low ceiling and
gaping fireplace after the fashion of old countryhouses
brown chest of drawers stood in one corner narrow
whitecounterpaned bed in another and dressingtable on the
lefthand side of the window these articles with two small
wickerwork chairs made up all the furniture in the room save
for square of wilton carpet in the centre the boards round and
the panelling of the walls were of brown wormeaten oak so old
and discoloured that it may have dated from the original building
of the house holmes drew one of the chairs into corner and sat
silent while his eyes travelled round and round and up and down
taking in every detail of the apartment

where does that bell communicate with he asked at last
pointing to thick bellrope which hung down beside the bed the
tassel actually lying upon the pillow

it goes to the housekeepers room

it looks newer than the other things

yes it was only put there couple of years ago

your sister asked for it suppose

no never heard of her using it we used always to get what we
wanted for ourselves

indeed it seemed unnecessary to put so nice bellpull there
you will excuse me for few minutes while satisfy myself as to
this floor he threw himself down upon his face with his lens in
his hand and crawled swiftly backward and forward examining
minutely the cracks between the boards then he did the same with
the woodwork with which the chamber was panelled finally he
walked over to the bed and spent some time in staring at it and
in running his eye up and down the wall finally he took the
bellrope in his hand and gave it brisk tug

why its dummy said he

wont it ring

no it is not even attached to wire this is very interesting
you can see now that it is fastened to hook just above where
the little opening for the ventilator is

how very absurd never noticed that before

very strange muttered holmes pulling at the rope there are
one or two very singular points about this room for example
what fool builder must be to open ventilator into another
room when with the same trouble he might have communicated
with the outside air

that is also quite modern said the lady

done about the same time as the bellrope remarked holmes

yes there were several little changes carried out about that
time

they seem to have been of most interesting characterdummy
bellropes and ventilators which do not ventilate with your
permission miss stoner we shall now carry our researches into
the inner apartment

dr grimesby roylotts chamber was larger than that of his
stepdaughter but was as plainly furnished campbed small
wooden shelf full of books mostly of technical character an
armchair beside the bed plain wooden chair against the wall
round table and large iron safe were the principal things
which met the eye holmes walked slowly round and examined each
and all of them with the keenest interest

whats in here he asked tapping the safe

my stepfathers business papers

oh you have seen inside then

only once some years ago remember that it was full of
papers

there isnt cat in it for example

no what strange idea

well look at this he took up small saucer of milk which
stood on the top of it

no we dont keep cat but there is cheetah and baboon

ah yes of course well cheetah is just big cat and yet
saucer of milk does not go very far in satisfying its wants
daresay there is one point which should wish to determine he
squatted down in front of the wooden chair and examined the seat
of it with the greatest attention

thank you that is quite settled said he rising and putting
his lens in his pocket hullo here is something interesting

the object which had caught his eye was small dog lash hung on
one corner of the bed the lash however was curled upon itself
and tied so as to make loop of whipcord

what do you make of that watson

its common enough lash but dont know why it should be
tied

that is not quite so common is it ah me its wicked world
and when clever man turns his brains to crime it is the worst
of all think that have seen enough now miss stoner and
with your permission we shall walk out upon the lawn

had never seen my friends face so grim or his brow so dark as
it was when we turned from the scene of this investigation we
had walked several times up and down the lawn neither miss
stoner nor myself liking to break in upon his thoughts before he
roused himself from his reverie

it is very essential miss stoner said he that you should
absolutely follow my advice in every respect

shall most certainly do so

the matter is too serious for any hesitation your life may
depend upon your compliance

assure you that am in your hands

in the first place both my friend and must spend the night in
your room

both miss stoner and gazed at him in astonishment

yes it must be so let me explain believe that that is the
village inn over there

yes that is the crown

very good your windows would be visible from there

certainly

you must confine yourself to your room on pretence of
headache when your stepfather comes back then when you hear him
retire for the night you must open the shutters of your window
undo the hasp put your lamp there as signal to us and then
withdraw quietly with everything which you are likely to want
into the room which you used to occupy have no doubt that in
spite of the repairs you could manage there for one night

oh yes easily

the rest you will leave in our hands

but what will you do

we shall spend the night in your room and we shall investigate
the cause of this noise which has disturbed you

believe mr holmes that you have already made up your mind
said miss stoner laying her hand upon my companions sleeve

perhaps have

then for pitys sake tell me what was the cause of my sisters
death

should prefer to have clearer proofs before speak

you can at least tell me whether my own thought is correct and
if she died from some sudden fright

no do not think so think that there was probably some more
tangible cause and now miss stoner we must leave you for if
dr roylott returned and saw us our journey would be in vain
goodbye and be brave for if you will do what have told you
you may rest assured that we shall soon drive away the dangers
that threaten you

sherlock holmes and had no difficulty in engaging bedroom and
sittingroom at the crown inn they were on the upper floor and
from our window we could command view of the avenue gate and
of the inhabited wing of stoke moran manor house at dusk we saw
dr grimesby roylott drive past his huge form looming up beside
the little figure of the lad who drove him the boy had some
slight difficulty in undoing the heavy iron gates and we heard
the hoarse roar of the doctors voice and saw the fury with which
he shook his clinched fists at him the trap drove on and few
minutes later we saw sudden light spring up among the trees as
the lamp was lit in one of the sittingrooms

do you know watson said holmes as we sat together in the
gathering darkness have really some scruples as to taking you
tonight there is distinct element of danger

can be of assistance

your presence might be invaluable

then shall certainly come

it is very kind of you

you speak of danger you have evidently seen more in these rooms
than was visible to me

no but fancy that may have deduced little more imagine
that you saw all that did

saw nothing remarkable save the bellrope and what purpose
that could answer confess is more than can imagine

you saw the ventilator too

yes but do not think that it is such very unusual thing to
have small opening between two rooms it was so small that
rat could hardly pass through

knew that we should find ventilator before ever we came to
stoke moran

my dear holmes

oh yes did you remember in her statement she said that her
sister could smell dr roylotts cigar now of course that
suggested at once that there must be communication between the
two rooms it could only be small one or it would have been
remarked upon at the coroners inquiry deduced ventilator

but what harm can there be in that

well there is at least curious coincidence of dates
ventilator is made cord is hung and lady who sleeps in the
bed dies does not that strike you

cannot as yet see any connection

did you observe anything very peculiar about that bed

no

it was clamped to the floor did you ever see bed fastened
like that before

cannot say that have

the lady could not move her bed it must always be in the same
relative position to the ventilator and to the ropeor so we may
call it since it was clearly never meant for bellpull

holmes cried seem to see dimly what you are hinting at
we are only just in time to prevent some subtle and horrible
crime

subtle enough and horrible enough when doctor does go wrong
he is the first of criminals he has nerve and he has knowledge
palmer and pritchard were among the heads of their profession
this man strikes even deeper but think watson that we shall
be able to strike deeper still but we shall have horrors enough
before the night is over for goodness sake let us have quiet
pipe and turn our minds for few hours to something more
cheerful


about nine oclock the light among the trees was extinguished
and all was dark in the direction of the manor house two hours
passed slowly away and then suddenly just at the stroke of
eleven single bright light shone out right in front of us

that is our signal said holmes springing to his feet it
comes from the middle window

as we passed out he exchanged few words with the landlord
explaining that we were going on late visit to an acquaintance
and that it was possible that we might spend the night there
moment later we were out on the dark road chill wind blowing
in our faces and one yellow light twinkling in front of us
through the gloom to guide us on our sombre errand

there was little difficulty in entering the grounds for
unrepaired breaches gaped in the old park wall making our way
among the trees we reached the lawn crossed it and were about
to enter through the window when out from clump of laurel
bushes there darted what seemed to be hideous and distorted
child who threw itself upon the grass with writhing limbs and
then ran swiftly across the lawn into the darkness

my god whispered did you see it

holmes was for the moment as startled as his hand closed like
vice upon my wrist in his agitation then he broke into low
laugh and put his lips to my ear

it is nice household he murmured that is the baboon

had forgotten the strange pets which the doctor affected there
was cheetah too perhaps we might find it upon our shoulders
at any moment confess that felt easier in my mind when
after following holmes example and slipping off my shoes
found myself inside the bedroom my companion noiselessly closed
the shutters moved the lamp onto the table and cast his eyes
round the room all was as we had seen it in the daytime then
creeping up to me and making trumpet of his hand he whispered
into my ear again so gently that it was all that could do to
distinguish the words

the least sound would be fatal to our plans

nodded to show that had heard

we must sit without light he would see it through the
ventilator

nodded again

do not go asleep your very life may depend upon it have your
pistol ready in case we should need it will sit on the side of
the bed and you in that chair

took out my revolver and laid it on the corner of the table

holmes had brought up long thin cane and this he placed upon
the bed beside him by it he laid the box of matches and the
stump of candle then he turned down the lamp and we were left
in darkness

how shall ever forget that dreadful vigil could not hear
sound not even the drawing of breath and yet knew that my
companion sat openeyed within few feet of me in the same
state of nervous tension in which was myself the shutters cut
off the least ray of light and we waited in absolute darkness

from outside came the occasional cry of nightbird and once at
our very window long drawn catlike whine which told us that
the cheetah was indeed at liberty far away we could hear the
deep tones of the parish clock which boomed out every quarter of
an hour how long they seemed those quarters twelve struck and
one and two and three and still we sat waiting silently for
whatever might befall

suddenly there was the momentary gleam of light up in the
direction of the ventilator which vanished immediately but was
succeeded by strong smell of burning oil and heated metal
someone in the next room had lit darklantern heard gentle
sound of movement and then all was silent once more though the
smell grew stronger for half an hour sat with straining ears
then suddenly another sound became audiblea very gentle
soothing sound like that of small jet of steam escaping
continually from kettle the instant that we heard it holmes
sprang from the bed struck match and lashed furiously with
his cane at the bellpull

you see it watson he yelled you see it

but saw nothing at the moment when holmes struck the light
heard low clear whistle but the sudden glare flashing into my
weary eyes made it impossible for me to tell what it was at which
my friend lashed so savagely could however see that his face
was deadly pale and filled with horror and loathing he had
ceased to strike and was gazing up at the ventilator when
suddenly there broke from the silence of the night the most
horrible cry to which have ever listened it swelled up louder
and louder hoarse yell of pain and fear and anger all mingled
in the one dreadful shriek they say that away down in the
village and even in the distant parsonage that cry raised the
sleepers from their beds it struck cold to our hearts and
stood gazing at holmes and he at me until the last echoes of it
had died away into the silence from which it rose

what can it mean gasped

it means that it is all over holmes answered and perhaps
after all it is for the best take your pistol and we will
enter dr roylotts room

with grave face he lit the lamp and led the way down the
corridor twice he struck at the chamber door without any reply
from within then he turned the handle and entered at his
heels with the cocked pistol in my hand

it was singular sight which met our eyes on the table stood
darklantern with the shutter half open throwing brilliant
beam of light upon the iron safe the door of which was ajar
beside this table on the wooden chair sat dr grimesby roylott
clad in long grey dressinggown his bare ankles protruding
beneath and his feet thrust into red heelless turkish slippers
across his lap lay the short stock with the long lash which we
had noticed during the day his chin was cocked upward and his
eyes were fixed in dreadful rigid stare at the corner of the
ceiling round his brow he had peculiar yellow band with
brownish speckles which seemed to be bound tightly round his
head as we entered he made neither sound nor motion

the band the speckled band whispered holmes

took step forward in an instant his strange headgear began
to move and there reared itself from among his hair the squat
diamondshaped head and puffed neck of loathsome serpent

it is swamp adder cried holmes the deadliest snake in
india he has died within ten seconds of being bitten violence
does in truth recoil upon the violent and the schemer falls
into the pit which he digs for another let us thrust this
creature back into its den and we can then remove miss stoner to
some place of shelter and let the county police know what has
happened

as he spoke he drew the dogwhip swiftly from the dead mans lap
and throwing the noose round the reptiles neck he drew it from
its horrid perch and carrying it at arms length threw it into
the iron safe which he closed upon it

such are the true facts of the death of dr grimesby roylott of
stoke moran it is not necessary that should prolong
narrative which has already run to too great length by telling
how we broke the sad news to the terrified girl how we conveyed
her by the morning train to the care of her good aunt at harrow
of how the slow process of official inquiry came to the
conclusion that the doctor met his fate while indiscreetly
playing with dangerous pet the little which had yet to learn
of the case was told me by sherlock holmes as we travelled back
next day

had said he come to an entirely erroneous conclusion which
shows my dear watson how dangerous it always is to reason from
insufficient data the presence of the gipsies and the use of
the word band which was used by the poor girl no doubt to
explain the appearance which she had caught hurried glimpse of
by the light of her match were sufficient to put me upon an
entirely wrong scent can only claim the merit that instantly
reconsidered my position when however it became clear to me
that whatever danger threatened an occupant of the room could not
come either from the window or the door my attention was
speedily drawn as have already remarked to you to this
ventilator and to the bellrope which hung down to the bed the
discovery that this was dummy and that the bed was clamped to
the floor instantly gave rise to the suspicion that the rope was
there as bridge for something passing through the hole and
coming to the bed the idea of snake instantly occurred to me
and when coupled it with my knowledge that the doctor was
furnished with supply of creatures from india felt that
was probably on the right track the idea of using form of
poison which could not possibly be discovered by any chemical
test was just such one as would occur to clever and ruthless
man who had had an eastern training the rapidity with which such
poison would take effect would also from his point of view be
an advantage it would be sharpeyed coroner indeed who could
distinguish the two little dark punctures which would show where
the poison fangs had done their work then thought of the
whistle of course he must recall the snake before the morning
light revealed it to the victim he had trained it probably by
the use of the milk which we saw to return to him when summoned
he would put it through this ventilator at the hour that he
thought best with the certainty that it would crawl down the
rope and land on the bed it might or might not bite the
occupant perhaps she might escape every night for week but
sooner or later she must fall victim

had come to these conclusions before ever had entered his
room an inspection of his chair showed me that he had been in
the habit of standing on it which of course would be necessary
in order that he should reach the ventilator the sight of the
safe the saucer of milk and the loop of whipcord were enough to
finally dispel any doubts which may have remained the metallic
clang heard by miss stoner was obviously caused by her stepfather
hastily closing the door of his safe upon its terrible occupant
having once made up my mind you know the steps which took in
order to put the matter to the proof heard the creature hiss
as have no doubt that you did also and instantly lit the
light and attacked it

with the result of driving it through the ventilator

and also with the result of causing it to turn upon its master
at the other side some of the blows of my cane came home and
roused its snakish temper so that it flew upon the first person
it saw in this way am no doubt indirectly responsible for dr
grimesby roylotts death and cannot say that it is likely to
weigh very heavily upon my conscience



ix the adventure of the engineers thumb

of all the problems which have been submitted to my friend mr
sherlock holmes for solution during the years of our intimacy
there were only two which was the means of introducing to his
noticethat of mr hatherleys thumb and that of colonel
warburtons madness of these the latter may have afforded
finer field for an acute and original observer but the other was
so strange in its inception and so dramatic in its details that
it may be the more worthy of being placed upon record even if it
gave my friend fewer openings for those deductive methods of
reasoning by which he achieved such remarkable results the story
has believe been told more than once in the newspapers but
like all such narratives its effect is much less striking when
set forth en bloc in single halfcolumn of print than when the
facts slowly evolve before your own eyes and the mystery clears
gradually away as each new discovery furnishes step which leads
on to the complete truth at the time the circumstances made
deep impression upon me and the lapse of two years has hardly
served to weaken the effect

it was in the summer of not long after my marriage that the
events occurred which am now about to summarise had returned
to civil practice and had finally abandoned holmes in his baker
street rooms although continually visited him and occasionally
even persuaded him to forgo his bohemian habits so far as to come
and visit us my practice had steadily increased and as
happened to live at no very great distance from paddington
station got few patients from among the officials one of
these whom had cured of painful and lingering disease was
never weary of advertising my virtues and of endeavouring to send
me on every sufferer over whom he might have any influence

one morning at little before seven oclock was awakened by
the maid tapping at the door to announce that two men had come
from paddington and were waiting in the consultingroom
dressed hurriedly for knew by experience that railway cases
were seldom trivial and hastened downstairs as descended my
old ally the guard came out of the room and closed the door
tightly behind him

ive got him here he whispered jerking his thumb over his
shoulder hes all right

what is it then asked for his manner suggested that it was
some strange creature which he had caged up in my room

its new patient he whispered thought id bring him
round myself then he couldnt slip away there he is all safe
and sound must go now doctor have my dooties just the
same as you and off he went this trusty tout without even
giving me time to thank him

entered my consultingroom and found gentleman seated by the
table he was quietly dressed in suit of heather tweed with
soft cloth cap which he had laid down upon my books round one of
his hands he had handkerchief wrapped which was mottled all
over with bloodstains he was young not more than
fiveandtwenty should say with strong masculine face but
he was exceedingly pale and gave me the impression of man who
was suffering from some strong agitation which it took all his
strength of mind to control

am sorry to knock you up so early doctor said he but
have had very serious accident during the night came in by
train this morning and on inquiring at paddington as to where
might find doctor worthy fellow very kindly escorted me
here gave the maid card but see that she has left it upon
the sidetable

took it up and glanced at it mr victor hatherley hydraulic
engineer victoria street floor that was the name
style and abode of my morning visitor regret that have
kept you waiting said sitting down in my librarychair you
are fresh from night journey understand which is in itself
monotonous occupation

oh my night could not be called monotonous said he and
laughed he laughed very heartily with high ringing note
leaning back in his chair and shaking his sides all my medical
instincts rose up against that laugh

stop it cried pull yourself together and poured out
some water from caraffe

it was useless however he was off in one of those hysterical
outbursts which come upon strong nature when some great crisis
is over and gone presently he came to himself once more very
weary and palelooking

have been making fool of myself he gasped

not at all drink this dashed some brandy into the water
and the colour began to come back to his bloodless cheeks

thats better said he and now doctor perhaps you would
kindly attend to my thumb or rather to the place where my thumb
used to be

he unwound the handkerchief and held out his hand it gave even
my hardened nerves shudder to look at it there were four
protruding fingers and horrid red spongy surface where the
thumb should have been it had been hacked or torn right out from
the roots

good heavens cried this is terrible injury it must have
bled considerably

yes it did fainted when it was done and think that must
have been senseless for long time when came to found that
it was still bleeding so tied one end of my handkerchief very
tightly round the wrist and braced it up with twig

excellent you should have been surgeon

it is question of hydraulics you see and came within my own
province

this has been done said examining the wound by very
heavy and sharp instrument

thing like cleaver said he

an accident presume

by no means

what murderous attack

very murderous indeed

you horrify me

sponged the wound cleaned it dressed it and finally covered
it over with cotton wadding and carbolised bandages he lay back
without wincing though he bit his lip from time to time

how is that asked when had finished

capital between your brandy and your bandage feel new man
was very weak but have had good deal to go through

perhaps you had better not speak of the matter it is evidently
trying to your nerves

oh no not now shall have to tell my tale to the police
but between ourselves if it were not for the convincing
evidence of this wound of mine should be surprised if they
believed my statement for it is very extraordinary one and
have not much in the way of proof with which to back it up and
even if they believe me the clues which can give them are so
vague that it is question whether justice will be done

ha cried if it is anything in the nature of problem
which you desire to see solved should strongly recommend you
to come to my friend mr sherlock holmes before you go to the
official police

oh have heard of that fellow answered my visitor and
should be very glad if he would take the matter up though of
course must use the official police as well would you give me
an introduction to him

ill do better ill take you round to him myself

should be immensely obliged to you

well call cab and go together we shall just be in time to
have little breakfast with him do you feel equal to it

yes shall not feel easy until have told my story

then my servant will call cab and shall be with you in an
instant rushed upstairs explained the matter shortly to my
wife and in five minutes was inside hansom driving with my
new acquaintance to baker street

sherlock holmes was as expected lounging about his
sittingroom in his dressinggown reading the agony column of the
times and smoking his beforebreakfast pipe which was composed
of all the plugs and dottles left from his smokes of the day
before all carefully dried and collected on the corner of the
mantelpiece he received us in his quietly genial fashion
ordered fresh rashers and eggs and joined us in hearty meal
when it was concluded he settled our new acquaintance upon the
sofa placed pillow beneath his head and laid glass of
brandy and water within his reach

it is easy to see that your experience has been no common one
mr hatherley said he pray lie down there and make yourself
absolutely at home tell us what you can but stop when you are
tired and keep up your strength with little stimulant

thank you said my patient but have felt another man since
the doctor bandaged me and think that your breakfast has
completed the cure shall take up as little of your valuable
time as possible so shall start at once upon my peculiar
experiences

holmes sat in his big armchair with the weary heavylidded
expression which veiled his keen and eager nature while sat
opposite to him and we listened in silence to the strange story
which our visitor detailed to us

you must know said he that am an orphan and bachelor
residing alone in lodgings in london by profession am
hydraulic engineer and have had considerable experience of my
work during the seven years that was apprenticed to venner
matheson the wellknown firm of greenwich two years ago
having served my time and having also come into fair sum of
money through my poor fathers death determined to start in
business for myself and took professional chambers in victoria
street

suppose that everyone finds his first independent start in
business dreary experience to me it has been exceptionally so
during two years have had three consultations and one small
job and that is absolutely all that my profession has brought
me my gross takings amount to pounds every day from
nine in the morning until four in the afternoon waited in my
little den until at last my heart began to sink and came to
believe that should never have any practice at all

yesterday however just as was thinking of leaving the
office my clerk entered to say there was gentleman waiting who
wished to see me upon business he brought up card too with
the name of colonel lysander stark engraved upon it close at
his heels came the colonel himself man rather over the middle
size but of an exceeding thinness do not think that have
ever seen so thin man his whole face sharpened away into nose
and chin and the skin of his cheeks was drawn quite tense over
his outstanding bones yet this emaciation seemed to be his
natural habit and due to no disease for his eye was bright his
step brisk and his bearing assured he was plainly but neatly
dressed and his age should judge would be nearer forty than
thirty

mr hatherley said he with something of german accent
you have been recommended to me mr hatherley as being man
who is not only proficient in his profession but is also discreet
and capable of preserving secret

bowed feeling as flattered as any young man would at such an
address may ask who it was who gave me so good character

well perhaps it is better that should not tell you that just
at this moment have it from the same source that you are both
an orphan and bachelor and are residing alone in london

that is quite correct answered but you will excuse me if
say that cannot see how all this bears upon my professional
qualifications understand that it was on professional matter
that you wished to speak to me

undoubtedly so but you will find that all say is really to
the point have professional commission for you but absolute
secrecy is quite essentialabsolute secrecy you understand and
of course we may expect that more from man who is alone than
from one who lives in the bosom of his family

if promise to keep secret said you may absolutely
depend upon my doing so

he looked very hard at me as spoke and it seemed to me that
had never seen so suspicious and questioning an eye

do you promise then said he at last

yes promise

absolute and complete silence before during and after no
reference to the matter at all either in word or writing

have already given you my word

very good he suddenly sprang up and darting like lightning
across the room he flung open the door the passage outside was
empty

thats all right said he coming back know that clerks are
sometimes curious as to their masters affairs now we can talk
in safety he drew up his chair very close to mine and began to
stare at me again with the same questioning and thoughtful look

feeling of repulsion and of something akin to fear had begun
to rise within me at the strange antics of this fleshless man
even my dread of losing client could not restrain me from
showing my impatience

beg that you will state your business sir said my time
is of value heaven forgive me for that last sentence but the
words came to my lips

how would fifty guineas for nights work suit you he asked

most admirably

say nights work but an hours would be nearer the mark
simply want your opinion about hydraulic stamping machine which
has got out of gear if you show us what is wrong we shall soon
set it right ourselves what do you think of such commission as
that

the work appears to be light and the pay munificent

precisely so we shall want you to come tonight by the last
train

where to

to eyford in berkshire it is little place near the borders
of oxfordshire and within seven miles of reading there is
train from paddington which would bring you there at about


very good

shall come down in carriage to meet you

there is drive then

yes our little place is quite out in the country it is good
seven miles from eyford station

then we can hardly get there before midnight suppose there
would be no chance of train back should be compelled to stop
the night

yes we could easily give you shakedown

that is very awkward could not come at some more convenient
hour

we have judged it best that you should come late it is to
recompense you for any inconvenience that we are paying to you
young and unknown man fee which would buy an opinion from the
very heads of your profession still of course if you would
like to draw out of the business there is plenty of time to do
so

thought of the fifty guineas and of how very useful they
would be to me not at all said shall be very happy to
accommodate myself to your wishes should like however to
understand little more clearly what it is that you wish me to
do

quite so it is very natural that the pledge of secrecy which
we have exacted from you should have aroused your curiosity
have no wish to commit you to anything without your having it all
laid before you suppose that we are absolutely safe from
eavesdroppers

entirely

then the matter stands thus you are probably aware that
fullersearth is valuable product and that it is only found
in one or two places in england

have heard so

some little time ago bought small placea very small
placewithin ten miles of reading was fortunate enough to
discover that there was deposit of fullersearth in one of my
fields on examining it however found that this deposit was
comparatively small one and that it formed link between two
very much larger ones upon the right and leftboth of them
however in the grounds of my neighbours these good people were
absolutely ignorant that their land contained that which was
quite as valuable as goldmine naturally it was to my
interest to buy their land before they discovered its true value
but unfortunately had no capital by which could do this
took few of my friends into the secret however and they
suggested that we should quietly and secretly work our own little
deposit and that in this way we should earn the money which would
enable us to buy the neighbouring fields this we have now been
doing for some time and in order to help us in our operations we
erected hydraulic press this press as have already
explained has got out of order and we wish your advice upon the
subject we guard our secret very jealously however and if it
once became known that we had hydraulic engineers coming to our
little house it would soon rouse inquiry and then if the facts
came out it would be goodbye to any chance of getting these
fields and carrying out our plans that is why have made you
promise me that you will not tell human being that you are
going to eyford tonight hope that make it all plain

quite follow you said the only point which could not
quite understand was what use you could make of hydraulic press
in excavating fullersearth which as understand is dug out
like gravel from pit

ah said he carelessly we have our own process we compress
the earth into bricks so as to remove them without revealing
what they are but that is mere detail have taken you fully
into my confidence now mr hatherley and have shown you how
trust you he rose as he spoke shall expect you then at
eyford at

shall certainly be there

and not word to soul he looked at me with last long
questioning gaze and then pressing my hand in cold dank
grasp he hurried from the room

well when came to think it all over in cool blood was very
much astonished as you may both think at this sudden commission
which had been intrusted to me on the one hand of course was
glad for the fee was at least tenfold what should have asked
had set price upon my own services and it was possible that
this order might lead to other ones on the other hand the face
and manner of my patron had made an unpleasant impression upon
me and could not think that his explanation of the
fullersearth was sufficient to explain the necessity for my
coming at midnight and his extreme anxiety lest should tell
anyone of my errand however threw all fears to the winds ate
hearty supper drove to paddington and started off having
obeyed to the letter the injunction as to holding my tongue

at reading had to change not only my carriage but my station
however was in time for the last train to eyford and
reached the little dimlit station after eleven oclock was the
only passenger who got out there and there was no one upon the
platform save single sleepy porter with lantern as passed
out through the wicket gate however found my acquaintance of
the morning waiting in the shadow upon the other side without
word he grasped my arm and hurried me into carriage the door
of which was standing open he drew up the windows on either
side tapped on the woodwork and away we went as fast as the
horse could go

one horse interjected holmes

yes only one

did you observe the colour

yes saw it by the sidelights when was stepping into the
carriage it was chestnut

tiredlooking or fresh

oh fresh and glossy

thank you am sorry to have interrupted you pray continue
your most interesting statement

away we went then and we drove for at least an hour colonel
lysander stark had said that it was only seven miles but
should think from the rate that we seemed to go and from the
time that we took that it must have been nearer twelve he sat
at my side in silence all the time and was aware more than
once when glanced in his direction that he was looking at me
with great intensity the country roads seem to be not very good
in that part of the world for we lurched and jolted terribly
tried to look out of the windows to see something of where we
were but they were made of frosted glass and could make out
nothing save the occasional bright blur of passing light now
and then hazarded some remark to break the monotony of the
journey but the colonel answered only in monosyllables and the
conversation soon flagged at last however the bumping of the
road was exchanged for the crisp smoothness of graveldrive
and the carriage came to stand colonel lysander stark sprang
out and as followed after him pulled me swiftly into porch
which gaped in front of us we stepped as it were right out of
the carriage and into the hall so that failed to catch the
most fleeting glance of the front of the house the instant that
had crossed the threshold the door slammed heavily behind us
and heard faintly the rattle of the wheels as the carriage
drove away

it was pitch dark inside the house and the colonel fumbled
about looking for matches and muttering under his breath
suddenly door opened at the other end of the passage and
long golden bar of light shot out in our direction it grew
broader and woman appeared with lamp in her hand which she
held above her head pushing her face forward and peering at us
could see that she was pretty and from the gloss with which
the light shone upon her dark dress knew that it was rich
material she spoke few words in foreign tongue in tone as
though asking question and when my companion answered in
gruff monosyllable she gave such start that the lamp nearly
fell from her hand colonel stark went up to her whispered
something in her ear and then pushing her back into the room
from whence she had come he walked towards me again with the
lamp in his hand

perhaps you will have the kindness to wait in this room for
few minutes said he throwing open another door it was
quiet little plainly furnished room with round table in the
centre on which several german books were scattered colonel
stark laid down the lamp on the top of harmonium beside the
door shall not keep you waiting an instant said he and
vanished into the darkness

glanced at the books upon the table and in spite of my
ignorance of german could see that two of them were treatises
on science the others being volumes of poetry then walked
across to the window hoping that might catch some glimpse of
the countryside but an oak shutter heavily barred was folded
across it it was wonderfully silent house there was an old
clock ticking loudly somewhere in the passage but otherwise
everything was deadly still vague feeling of uneasiness began
to steal over me who were these german people and what were
they doing living in this strange outoftheway place and
where was the place was ten miles or so from eyford that was
all knew but whether north south east or west had no
idea for that matter reading and possibly other large towns
were within that radius so the place might not be so secluded
after all yet it was quite certain from the absolute stillness
that we were in the country paced up and down the room
humming tune under my breath to keep up my spirits and feeling
that was thoroughly earning my fiftyguinea fee

suddenly without any preliminary sound in the midst of the
utter stillness the door of my room swung slowly open the woman
was standing in the aperture the darkness of the hall behind
her the yellow light from my lamp beating upon her eager and
beautiful face could see at glance that she was sick with
fear and the sight sent chill to my own heart she held up one
shaking finger to warn me to be silent and she shot few
whispered words of broken english at me her eyes glancing back
like those of frightened horse into the gloom behind her

would go said she trying hard as it seemed to me to
speak calmly would go should not stay here there is no
good for you to do

but madam said have not yet done what came for
cannot possibly leave until have seen the machine

it is not worth your while to wait she went on you can pass
through the door no one hinders and then seeing that smiled
and shook my head she suddenly threw aside her constraint and
made step forward with her hands wrung together for the love
of heaven she whispered get away from here before it is too
late

but am somewhat headstrong by nature and the more ready to
engage in an affair when there is some obstacle in the way
thought of my fiftyguinea fee of my wearisome journey and of
the unpleasant night which seemed to be before me was it all to
go for nothing why should slink away without having carried
out my commission and without the payment which was my due this
woman might for all knew be monomaniac with stout
bearing therefore though her manner had shaken me more than
cared to confess still shook my head and declared my intention
of remaining where was she was about to renew her entreaties
when door slammed overhead and the sound of several footsteps
was heard upon the stairs she listened for an instant threw up
her hands with despairing gesture and vanished as suddenly and
as noiselessly as she had come

the newcomers were colonel lysander stark and short thick man
with chinchilla beard growing out of the creases of his double
chin who was introduced to me as mr ferguson

this is my secretary and manager said the colonel by the
way was under the impression that left this door shut just
now fear that you have felt the draught

on the contrary said opened the door myself because
felt the room to be little close

he shot one of his suspicious looks at me perhaps we had
better proceed to business then said he mr ferguson and
will take you up to see the machine

had better put my hat on suppose

oh no it is in the house

what you dig fullersearth in the house

no no this is only where we compress it but never mind that
all we wish you to do is to examine the machine and to let us
know what is wrong with it

we went upstairs together the colonel first with the lamp the
fat manager and behind him it was labyrinth of an old house
with corridors passages narrow winding staircases and little
low doors the thresholds of which were hollowed out by the
generations who had crossed them there were no carpets and no
signs of any furniture above the ground floor while the plaster
was peeling off the walls and the damp was breaking through in
green unhealthy blotches tried to put on as unconcerned an
air as possible but had not forgotten the warnings of the
lady even though disregarded them and kept keen eye upon
my two companions ferguson appeared to be morose and silent
man but could see from the little that he said that he was at
least fellowcountryman

colonel lysander stark stopped at last before low door which
he unlocked within was small square room in which the three
of us could hardly get at one time ferguson remained outside
and the colonel ushered me in

we are now said he actually within the hydraulic press and
it would be particularly unpleasant thing for us if anyone were
to turn it on the ceiling of this small chamber is really the
end of the descending piston and it comes down with the force of
many tons upon this metal floor there are small lateral columns
of water outside which receive the force and which transmit and
multiply it in the manner which is familiar to you the machine
goes readily enough but there is some stiffness in the working
of it and it has lost little of its force perhaps you will
have the goodness to look it over and to show us how we can set
it right

took the lamp from him and examined the machine very
thoroughly it was indeed gigantic one and capable of
exercising enormous pressure when passed outside however and
pressed down the levers which controlled it knew at once by
the whishing sound that there was slight leakage which allowed
regurgitation of water through one of the side cylinders an
examination showed that one of the indiarubber bands which was
round the head of drivingrod had shrunk so as not quite to
fill the socket along which it worked this was clearly the cause
of the loss of power and pointed it out to my companions who
followed my remarks very carefully and asked several practical
questions as to how they should proceed to set it right when
had made it clear to them returned to the main chamber of the
machine and took good look at it to satisfy my own curiosity
it was obvious at glance that the story of the fullersearth
was the merest fabrication for it would be absurd to suppose
that so powerful an engine could be designed for so inadequate
purpose the walls were of wood but the floor consisted of
large iron trough and when came to examine it could see
crust of metallic deposit all over it had stooped and was
scraping at this to see exactly what it was when heard
muttered exclamation in german and saw the cadaverous face of the
colonel looking down at me

what are you doing there he asked

felt angry at having been tricked by so elaborate story as
that which he had told me was admiring your fullersearth
said think that should be better able to advise you as to
your machine if knew what the exact purpose was for which it
was used

the instant that uttered the words regretted the rashness of
my speech his face set hard and baleful light sprang up in
his grey eyes

very well said he you shall know all about the machine he
took step backward slammed the little door and turned the key
in the lock rushed towards it and pulled at the handle but it
was quite secure and did not give in the least to my kicks and
shoves hullo yelled hullo colonel let me out

and then suddenly in the silence heard sound which sent my
heart into my mouth it was the clank of the levers and the swish
of the leaking cylinder he had set the engine at work the lamp
still stood upon the floor where had placed it when examining
the trough by its light saw that the black ceiling was coming
down upon me slowly jerkily but as none knew better than
myself with force which must within minute grind me to
shapeless pulp threw myself screaming against the door and
dragged with my nails at the lock implored the colonel to let
me out but the remorseless clanking of the levers drowned my
cries the ceiling was only foot or two above my head and with
my hand upraised could feel its hard rough surface then it
flashed through my mind that the pain of my death would depend
very much upon the position in which met it if lay on my
face the weight would come upon my spine and shuddered to
think of that dreadful snap easier the other way perhaps and
yet had the nerve to lie and look up at that deadly black
shadow wavering down upon me already was unable to stand
erect when my eye caught something which brought gush of hope
back to my heart

have said that though the floor and ceiling were of iron the
walls were of wood as gave last hurried glance around saw
thin line of yellow light between two of the boards which
broadened and broadened as small panel was pushed backward for
an instant could hardly believe that here was indeed door
which led away from death the next instant threw myself
through and lay halffainting upon the other side the panel had
closed again behind me but the crash of the lamp and few
moments afterwards the clang of the two slabs of metal told me
how narrow had been my escape

was recalled to myself by frantic plucking at my wrist and
found myself lying upon the stone floor of narrow corridor
while woman bent over me and tugged at me with her left hand
while she held candle in her right it was the same good friend
whose warning had so foolishly rejected

come come she cried breathlessly they will be here in
moment they will see that you are not there oh do not waste
the soprecious time but come

this time at least did not scorn her advice staggered to
my feet and ran with her along the corridor and down winding
stair the latter led to another broad passage and just as we
reached it we heard the sound of running feet and the shouting of
two voices one answering the other from the floor on which we
were and from the one beneath my guide stopped and looked about
her like one who is at her wits end then she threw open door
which led into bedroom through the window of which the moon
was shining brightly

it is your only chance said she it is high but it may be
that you can jump it

as she spoke light sprang into view at the further end of the
passage and saw the lean figure of colonel lysander stark
rushing forward with lantern in one hand and weapon like
butchers cleaver in the other rushed across the bedroom
flung open the window and looked out how quiet and sweet and
wholesome the garden looked in the moonlight and it could not be
more than thirty feet down clambered out upon the sill but
hesitated to jump until should have heard what passed between
my saviour and the ruffian who pursued me if she were illused
then at any risks was determined to go back to her assistance
the thought had hardly flashed through my mind before he was at
the door pushing his way past her but she threw her arms round
him and tried to hold him back

fritz fritz she cried in english remember your promise
after the last time you said it should not be again he will be
silent oh he will be silent

you are mad elise he shouted struggling to break away from
her you will be the ruin of us he has seen too much let me
pass say he dashed her to one side and rushing to the
window cut at me with his heavy weapon had let myself go and
was hanging by the hands to the sill when his blow fell was
conscious of dull pain my grip loosened and fell into the
garden below

was shaken but not hurt by the fall so picked myself up and
rushed off among the bushes as hard as could run for
understood that was far from being out of danger yet suddenly
however as ran deadly dizziness and sickness came over me
glanced down at my hand which was throbbing painfully and
then for the first time saw that my thumb had been cut off and
that the blood was pouring from my wound endeavoured to tie my
handkerchief round it but there came sudden buzzing in my
ears and next moment fell in dead faint among the
rosebushes

how long remained unconscious cannot tell it must have been
very long time for the moon had sunk and bright morning was
breaking when came to myself my clothes were all sodden with
dew and my coatsleeve was drenched with blood from my wounded
thumb the smarting of it recalled in an instant all the
particulars of my nights adventure and sprang to my feet with
the feeling that might hardly yet be safe from my pursuers but
to my astonishment when came to look round me neither house
nor garden were to be seen had been lying in an angle of the
hedge close by the highroad and just little lower down was
long building which proved upon my approaching it to be the
very station at which had arrived upon the previous night were
it not for the ugly wound upon my hand all that had passed
during those dreadful hours might have been an evil dream

half dazed went into the station and asked about the morning
train there would be one to reading in less than an hour the
same porter was on duty found as had been there when
arrived inquired of him whether he had ever heard of colonel
lysander stark the name was strange to him had he observed
carriage the night before waiting for me no he had not was
there policestation anywhere near there was one about three
miles off

it was too far for me to go weak and ill as was determined
to wait until got back to town before telling my story to the
police it was little past six when arrived so went first
to have my wound dressed and then the doctor was kind enough to
bring me along here put the case into your hands and shall do
exactly what you advise

we both sat in silence for some little time after listening to
this extraordinary narrative then sherlock holmes pulled down
from the shelf one of the ponderous commonplace books in which he
placed his cuttings

here is an advertisement which will interest you said he it
appeared in all the papers about year ago listen to this
lost on the inst mr jeremiah hayling aged
twentysix hydraulic engineer left his lodgings at ten
oclock at night and has not been heard of since was
dressed in etc etc ha that represents the last time that
the colonel needed to have his machine overhauled fancy

good heavens cried my patient then that explains what the
girl said

undoubtedly it is quite clear that the colonel was cool and
desperate man who was absolutely determined that nothing should
stand in the way of his little game like those outandout
pirates who will leave no survivor from captured ship well
every moment now is precious so if you feel equal to it we shall
go down to scotland yard at once as preliminary to starting for
eyford

some three hours or so afterwards we were all in the train
together bound from reading to the little berkshire village
there were sherlock holmes the hydraulic engineer inspector
bradstreet of scotland yard plainclothes man and myself
bradstreet had spread an ordnance map of the county out upon the
seat and was busy with his compasses drawing circle with eyford
for its centre

there you are said he that circle is drawn at radius of
ten miles from the village the place we want must be somewhere
near that line you said ten miles think sir

it was an hours good drive

and you think that they brought you back all that way when you
were unconscious

they must have done so have confused memory too of having
been lifted and conveyed somewhere

what cannot understand said is why they should have
spared you when they found you lying fainting in the garden
perhaps the villain was softened by the womans entreaties

hardly think that likely never saw more inexorable face
in my life

oh we shall soon clear up all that said bradstreet well
have drawn my circle and only wish knew at what point upon
it the folk that we are in search of are to be found

think could lay my finger on it said holmes quietly

really now cried the inspector you have formed your
opinion come now we shall see who agrees with you say it is
south for the country is more deserted there

and say east said my patient

am for west remarked the plainclothes man there are
several quiet little villages up there

and am for north said because there are no hills there
and our friend says that he did not notice the carriage go up
any

come cried the inspector laughing its very pretty
diversity of opinion we have boxed the compass among us who do
you give your casting vote to

you are all wrong

but we cant all be

oh yes you can this is my point he placed his finger in the
centre of the circle this is where we shall find them

but the twelvemile drive gasped hatherley

six out and six back nothing simpler you say yourself that the
horse was fresh and glossy when you got in how could it be that
if it had gone twelve miles over heavy roads

indeed it is likely ruse enough observed bradstreet
thoughtfully of course there can be no doubt as to the nature
of this gang

none at all said holmes they are coiners on large scale
and have used the machine to form the amalgam which has taken the
place of silver

we have known for some time that clever gang was at work
said the inspector they have been turning out halfcrowns by
the thousand we even traced them as far as reading but could
get no farther for they had covered their traces in way that
showed that they were very old hands but now thanks to this
lucky chance think that we have got them right enough

but the inspector was mistaken for those criminals were not
destined to fall into the hands of justice as we rolled into
eyford station we saw gigantic column of smoke which streamed
up from behind small clump of trees in the neighbourhood and
hung like an immense ostrich feather over the landscape

house on fire asked bradstreet as the train steamed off
again on its way

yes sir said the stationmaster

when did it break out

hear that it was during the night sir but it has got worse
and the whole place is in blaze

whose house is it

dr bechers

tell me broke in the engineer is dr becher german very
thin with long sharp nose

the stationmaster laughed heartily no sir dr becher is an
englishman and there isnt man in the parish who has
betterlined waistcoat but he has gentleman staying with him
patient as understand who is foreigner and he looks as
if little good berkshire beef would do him no harm

the stationmaster had not finished his speech before we were all
hastening in the direction of the fire the road topped low
hill and there was great widespread whitewashed building in
front of us spouting fire at every chink and window while in
the garden in front three fireengines were vainly striving to
keep the flames under

thats it cried hatherley in intense excitement there is
the graveldrive and there are the rosebushes where lay that
second window is the one that jumped from

well at least said holmes you have had your revenge upon
them there can be no question that it was your oillamp which
when it was crushed in the press set fire to the wooden walls
though no doubt they were too excited in the chase after you to
observe it at the time now keep your eyes open in this crowd for
your friends of last night though very much fear that they are
good hundred miles off by now

and holmes fears came to be realised for from that day to this
no word has ever been heard either of the beautiful woman the
sinister german or the morose englishman early that morning
peasant had met cart containing several people and some very
bulky boxes driving rapidly in the direction of reading but
there all traces of the fugitives disappeared and even holmes
ingenuity failed ever to discover the least clue as to their
whereabouts

the firemen had been much perturbed at the strange arrangements
which they had found within and still more so by discovering
newly severed human thumb upon windowsill of the second floor
about sunset however their efforts were at last successful and
they subdued the flames but not before the roof had fallen in
and the whole place been reduced to such absolute ruin that save
some twisted cylinders and iron piping not trace remained of
the machinery which had cost our unfortunate acquaintance so
dearly large masses of nickel and of tin were discovered stored
in an outhouse but no coins were to be found which may have
explained the presence of those bulky boxes which have been
already referred to

how our hydraulic engineer had been conveyed from the garden to
the spot where he recovered his senses might have remained
forever mystery were it not for the soft mould which told us
very plain tale he had evidently been carried down by two
persons one of whom had remarkably small feet and the other
unusually large ones on the whole it was most probable that the
silent englishman being less bold or less murderous than his
companion had assisted the woman to bear the unconscious man out
of the way of danger

well said our engineer ruefully as we took our seats to return
once more to london it has been pretty business for me
have lost my thumb and have lost fiftyguinea fee and what
have gained

experience said holmes laughing indirectly it may be of
value you know you have only to put it into words to gain the
reputation of being excellent company for the remainder of your
existence



the adventure of the noble bachelor

the lord st simon marriage and its curious termination have
long ceased to be subject of interest in those exalted circles
in which the unfortunate bridegroom moves fresh scandals have
eclipsed it and their more piquant details have drawn the
gossips away from this fouryearold drama as have reason to
believe however that the full facts have never been revealed to
the general public and as my friend sherlock holmes had
considerable share in clearing the matter up feel that no
memoir of him would be complete without some little sketch of
this remarkable episode

it was few weeks before my own marriage during the days when
was still sharing rooms with holmes in baker street that he came
home from an afternoon stroll to find letter on the table
waiting for him had remained indoors all day for the weather
had taken sudden turn to rain with high autumnal winds and
the jezail bullet which had brought back in one of my limbs as
relic of my afghan campaign throbbed with dull persistence
with my body in one easychair and my legs upon another had
surrounded myself with cloud of newspapers until at last
saturated with the news of the day tossed them all aside and
lay listless watching the huge crest and monogram upon the
envelope upon the table and wondering lazily who my friends
noble correspondent could be

here is very fashionable epistle remarked as he entered
your morning letters if remember right were from
fishmonger and tidewaiter

yes my correspondence has certainly the charm of variety he
answered smiling and the humbler are usually the more
interesting this looks like one of those unwelcome social
summonses which call upon man either to be bored or to lie

he broke the seal and glanced over the contents

oh come it may prove to be something of interest after all

not social then

no distinctly professional

and from noble client

one of the highest in england

my dear fellow congratulate you

assure you watson without affectation that the status of my
client is matter of less moment to me than the interest of his
case it is just possible however that that also may not be
wanting in this new investigation you have been reading the
papers diligently of late have you not

it looks like it said ruefully pointing to huge bundle in
the corner have had nothing else to do

it is fortunate for you will perhaps be able to post me up
read nothing except the criminal news and the agony column the
latter is always instructive but if you have followed recent
events so closely you must have read about lord st simon and his
wedding

oh yes with the deepest interest

that is well the letter which hold in my hand is from lord
st simon will read it to you and in return you must turn
over these papers and let me have whatever bears upon the matter
this is what he says

my dear mr sherlock holmeslord backwater tells me that
may place implicit reliance upon your judgment and discretion
have determined therefore to call upon you and to consult you
in reference to the very painful event which has occurred in
connection with my wedding mr lestrade of scotland yard is
acting already in the matter but he assures me that he sees no
objection to your cooperation and that he even thinks that
it might be of some assistance will call at four oclock in
the afternoon and should you have any other engagement at that
time hope that you will postpone it as this matter is of
paramount importance yours faithfully st simon

it is dated from grosvenor mansions written with quill pen
and the noble lord has had the misfortune to get smear of ink
upon the outer side of his right little finger remarked holmes
as he folded up the epistle

he says four oclock it is three now he will be here in an
hour

then have just time with your assistance to get clear upon
the subject turn over those papers and arrange the extracts in
their order of time while take glance as to who our client
is he picked redcovered volume from line of books of
reference beside the mantelpiece here he is said he sitting
down and flattening it out upon his knee lord robert walsingham
de vere st simon second son of the duke of balmoral hum arms
azure three caltrops in chief over fess sable born in
hes fortyone years of age which is mature for marriage was
undersecretary for the colonies in late administration the
duke his father was at one time secretary for foreign affairs
they inherit plantagenet blood by direct descent and tudor on
the distaff side ha well there is nothing very instructive in
all this think that must turn to you watson for something
more solid

have very little difficulty in finding what want said
for the facts are quite recent and the matter struck me as
remarkable feared to refer them to you however as knew
that you had an inquiry on hand and that you disliked the
intrusion of other matters

oh you mean the little problem of the grosvenor square
furniture van that is quite cleared up nowthough indeed it
was obvious from the first pray give me the results of your
newspaper selections

here is the first notice which can find it is in the personal
column of the morning post and dates as you see some weeks
back marriage has been arranged it says and will if
rumour is correct very shortly take place between lord robert
st simon second son of the duke of balmoral and miss hatty
doran the only daughter of aloysius doran esq of san
francisco cal usa that is all

terse and to the point remarked holmes stretching his long
thin legs towards the fire

there was paragraph amplifying this in one of the society
papers of the same week ah here it is there will soon be
call for protection in the marriage market for the present
freetrade principle appears to tell heavily against our home
product one by one the management of the noble houses of great
britain is passing into the hands of our fair cousins from across
the atlantic an important addition has been made during the last
week to the list of the prizes which have been borne away by
these charming invaders lord st simon who has shown himself
for over twenty years proof against the little gods arrows has
now definitely announced his approaching marriage with miss hatty
doran the fascinating daughter of california millionaire miss
doran whose graceful figure and striking face attracted much
attention at the westbury house festivities is an only child
and it is currently reported that her dowry will run to
considerably over the six figures with expectancies for the
future as it is an open secret that the duke of balmoral has
been compelled to sell his pictures within the last few years
and as lord st simon has no property of his own save the small
estate of birchmoor it is obvious that the californian heiress
is not the only gainer by an alliance which will enable her to
make the easy and common transition from republican lady to
british peeress

anything else asked holmes yawning

oh yes plenty then there is another note in the morning post
to say that the marriage would be an absolutely quiet one that it
would be at st georges hanover square that only half dozen
intimate friends would be invited and that the party would
return to the furnished house at lancaster gate which has been
taken by mr aloysius doran two days laterthat is on
wednesday lastthere is curt announcement that the wedding had
taken place and that the honeymoon would be passed at lord
backwaters place near petersfield those are all the notices
which appeared before the disappearance of the bride

before the what asked holmes with start

the vanishing of the lady

when did she vanish then

at the wedding breakfast

indeed this is more interesting than it promised to be quite
dramatic in fact

yes it struck me as being little out of the common

they often vanish before the ceremony and occasionally during
the honeymoon but cannot call to mind anything quite so prompt
as this pray let me have the details

warn you that they are very incomplete

perhaps we may make them less so

such as they are they are set forth in single article of
morning paper of yesterday which will read to you it is
headed singular occurrence at fashionable wedding

the family of lord robert st simon has been thrown into the
greatest consternation by the strange and painful episodes which
have taken place in connection with his wedding the ceremony as
shortly announced in the papers of yesterday occurred on the
previous morning but it is only now that it has been possible to
confirm the strange rumours which have been so persistently
floating about in spite of the attempts of the friends to hush
the matter up so much public attention has now been drawn to it
that no good purpose can be served by affecting to disregard what
is common subject for conversation

the ceremony which was performed at st georges hanover
square was very quiet one no one being present save the
father of the bride mr aloysius doran the duchess of balmoral
lord backwater lord eustace and lady clara st simon the
younger brother and sister of the bridegroom and lady alicia
whittington the whole party proceeded afterwards to the house of
mr aloysius doran at lancaster gate where breakfast had been
prepared it appears that some little trouble was caused by
woman whose name has not been ascertained who endeavoured to
force her way into the house after the bridal party alleging
that she had some claim upon lord st simon it was only after
painful and prolonged scene that she was ejected by the butler
and the footman the bride who had fortunately entered the house
before this unpleasant interruption had sat down to breakfast
with the rest when she complained of sudden indisposition and
retired to her room her prolonged absence having caused some
comment her father followed her but learned from her maid that
she had only come up to her chamber for an instant caught up an
ulster and bonnet and hurried down to the passage one of the
footmen declared that he had seen lady leave the house thus
apparelled but had refused to credit that it was his mistress
believing her to be with the company on ascertaining that his
daughter had disappeared mr aloysius doran in conjunction with
the bridegroom instantly put themselves in communication with
the police and very energetic inquiries are being made which
will probably result in speedy clearing up of this very
singular business up to late hour last night however nothing
had transpired as to the whereabouts of the missing lady there
are rumours of foul play in the matter and it is said that the
police have caused the arrest of the woman who had caused the
original disturbance in the belief that from jealousy or some
other motive she may have been concerned in the strange
disappearance of the bride

and is that all

only one little item in another of the morning papers but it is
suggestive one

and it is

that miss flora millar the lady who had caused the disturbance
has actually been arrested it appears that she was formerly
danseuse at the allegro and that she has known the bridegroom
for some years there are no further particulars and the whole
case is in your hands nowso far as it has been set forth in the
public press

and an exceedingly interesting case it appears to be would
not have missed it for worlds but there is ring at the bell
watson and as the clock makes it few minutes after four
have no doubt that this will prove to be our noble client do not
dream of going watson for very much prefer having witness
if only as check to my own memory

lord robert st simon announced our pageboy throwing open
the door gentleman entered with pleasant cultured face
highnosed and pale with something perhaps of petulance about
the mouth and with the steady wellopened eye of man whose
pleasant lot it had ever been to command and to be obeyed his
manner was brisk and yet his general appearance gave an undue
impression of age for he had slight forward stoop and little
bend of the knees as he walked his hair too as he swept off
his very curlybrimmed hat was grizzled round the edges and thin
upon the top as to his dress it was careful to the verge of
foppishness with high collar black frockcoat white waistcoat
yellow gloves patentleather shoes and lightcoloured gaiters
he advanced slowly into the room turning his head from left to
right and swinging in his right hand the cord which held his
golden eyeglasses

goodday lord st simon said holmes rising and bowing pray
take the basketchair this is my friend and colleague dr
watson draw up little to the fire and we will talk this
matter over

most painful matter to me as you can most readily imagine
mr holmes have been cut to the quick understand that you
have already managed several delicate cases of this sort sir
though presume that they were hardly from the same class of
society

no am descending

beg pardon

my last client of the sort was king

oh really had no idea and which king

the king of scandinavia

what had he lost his wife

you can understand said holmes suavely that extend to the
affairs of my other clients the same secrecy which promise to
you in yours

of course very right very right im sure beg pardon as to
my own case am ready to give you any information which may
assist you in forming an opinion

thank you have already learned all that is in the public
prints nothing more presume that may take it as correctthis
article for example as to the disappearance of the bride

lord st simon glanced over it yes it is correct as far as it
goes

but it needs great deal of supplementing before anyone could
offer an opinion think that may arrive at my facts most
directly by questioning you

pray do so

when did you first meet miss hatty doran

in san francisco year ago

you were travelling in the states

yes

did you become engaged then

no

but you were on friendly footing

was amused by her society and she could see that was
amused

her father is very rich

he is said to be the richest man on the pacific slope

and how did he make his money

in mining he had nothing few years ago then he struck gold
invested it and came up by leaps and bounds

now what is your own impression as to the young ladysyour
wifes character

the nobleman swung his glasses little faster and stared down
into the fire you see mr holmes said he my wife was
twenty before her father became rich man during that time she
ran free in mining camp and wandered through woods or
mountains so that her education has come from nature rather than
from the schoolmaster she is what we call in england tomboy
with strong nature wild and free unfettered by any sort of
traditions she is impetuousvolcanic was about to say she
is swift in making up her mind and fearless in carrying out her
resolutions on the other hand would not have given her the
name which have the honour to bearhe gave little stately
coughhad not thought her to be at bottom noble woman
believe that she is capable of heroic selfsacrifice and that
anything dishonourable would be repugnant to her

have you her photograph

brought this with me he opened locket and showed us the
full face of very lovely woman it was not photograph but an
ivory miniature and the artist had brought out the full effect
of the lustrous black hair the large dark eyes and the
exquisite mouth holmes gazed long and earnestly at it then he
closed the locket and handed it back to lord st simon

the young lady came to london then and you renewed your
acquaintance

yes her father brought her over for this last london season
met her several times became engaged to her and have now
married her

she brought understand considerable dowry

fair dowry not more than is usual in my family

and this of course remains to you since the marriage is
fait accompli

really have made no inquiries on the subject

very naturally not did you see miss doran on the day before the
wedding

yes

was she in good spirits

never better she kept talking of what we should do in our
future lives

indeed that is very interesting and on the morning of the
wedding

she was as bright as possibleat least until after the
ceremony

and did you observe any change in her then

well to tell the truth saw then the first signs that had
ever seen that her temper was just little sharp the incident
however was too trivial to relate and can have no possible
bearing upon the case

pray let us have it for all that

oh it is childish she dropped her bouquet as we went towards
the vestry she was passing the front pew at the time and it
fell over into the pew there was moments delay but the
gentleman in the pew handed it up to her again and it did not
appear to be the worse for the fall yet when spoke to her of
the matter she answered me abruptly and in the carriage on our
way home she seemed absurdly agitated over this trifling cause

indeed you say that there was gentleman in the pew some of
the general public were present then

oh yes it is impossible to exclude them when the church is
open

this gentleman was not one of your wifes friends

no no call him gentleman by courtesy but he was quite
commonlooking person hardly noticed his appearance but
really think that we are wandering rather far from the point

lady st simon then returned from the wedding in less
cheerful frame of mind than she had gone to it what did she do
on reentering her fathers house

saw her in conversation with her maid

and who is her maid

alice is her name she is an american and came from california
with her

confidential servant

little too much so it seemed to me that her mistress allowed
her to take great liberties still of course in america they
look upon these things in different way

how long did she speak to this alice

oh few minutes had something else to think of

you did not overhear what they said

lady st simon said something about jumping claim she was
accustomed to use slang of the kind have no idea what she
meant

american slang is very expressive sometimes and what did your
wife do when she finished speaking to her maid

she walked into the breakfastroom

on your arm

no alone she was very independent in little matters like that
then after we had sat down for ten minutes or so she rose
hurriedly muttered some words of apology and left the room she
never came back

but this maid alice as understand deposes that she went to
her room covered her brides dress with long ulster put on
bonnet and went out

quite so and she was afterwards seen walking into hyde park in
company with flora millar woman who is now in custody and who
had already made disturbance at mr dorans house that
morning

ah yes should like few particulars as to this young lady
and your relations to her

lord st simon shrugged his shoulders and raised his eyebrows
we have been on friendly footing for some yearsi may say on
very friendly footing she used to be at the allegro have
not treated her ungenerously and she had no just cause of
complaint against me but you know what women are mr holmes
flora was dear little thing but exceedingly hotheaded and
devotedly attached to me she wrote me dreadful letters when she
heard that was about to be married and to tell the truth the
reason why had the marriage celebrated so quietly was that
feared lest there might be scandal in the church she came to
mr dorans door just after we returned and she endeavoured to
push her way in uttering very abusive expressions towards my
wife and even threatening her but had foreseen the
possibility of something of the sort and had two police
fellows there in private clothes who soon pushed her out again
she was quiet when she saw that there was no good in making
row

did your wife hear all this

no thank goodness she did not

and she was seen walking with this very woman afterwards

yes that is what mr lestrade of scotland yard looks upon as
so serious it is thought that flora decoyed my wife out and laid
some terrible trap for her

well it is possible supposition

you think so too

did not say probable one but you do not yourself look upon
this as likely

do not think flora would hurt fly

still jealousy is strange transformer of characters pray
what is your own theory as to what took place

well really came to seek theory not to propound one
have given you all the facts since you ask me however may
say that it has occurred to me as possible that the excitement of
this affair the consciousness that she had made so immense
social stride had the effect of causing some little nervous
disturbance in my wife

in short that she had become suddenly deranged

well really when consider that she has turned her backi
will not say upon me but upon so much that many have aspired to
without successi can hardly explain it in any other fashion

well certainly that is also conceivable hypothesis said
holmes smiling and now lord st simon think that have
nearly all my data may ask whether you were seated at the
breakfasttable so that you could see out of the window

we could see the other side of the road and the park

quite so then do not think that need to detain you longer
shall communicate with you

should you be fortunate enough to solve this problem said our
client rising

have solved it

eh what was that

say that have solved it

where then is my wife

that is detail which shall speedily supply

lord st simon shook his head am afraid that it will take
wiser heads than yours or mine he remarked and bowing in
stately oldfashioned manner he departed

it is very good of lord st simon to honour my head by putting
it on level with his own said sherlock holmes laughing
think that shall have whisky and soda and cigar after all
this crossquestioning had formed my conclusions as to the
case before our client came into the room

my dear holmes

have notes of several similar cases though none as
remarked before which were quite as prompt my whole examination
served to turn my conjecture into certainty circumstantial
evidence is occasionally very convincing as when you find
trout in the milk to quote thoreaus example

but have heard all that you have heard

without however the knowledge of preexisting cases which
serves me so well there was parallel instance in aberdeen some
years back and something on very much the same lines at munich
the year after the francoprussian war it is one of these
casesbut hullo here is lestrade goodafternoon lestrade
you will find an extra tumbler upon the sideboard and there are
cigars in the box

the official detective was attired in peajacket and cravat
which gave him decidedly nautical appearance and he carried
black canvas bag in his hand with short greeting he seated
himself and lit the cigar which had been offered to him

whats up then asked holmes with twinkle in his eye you
look dissatisfied

and feel dissatisfied it is this infernal st simon marriage
case can make neither head nor tail of the business

really you surprise me

who ever heard of such mixed affair every clue seems to slip
through my fingers have been at work upon it all day

and very wet it seems to have made you said holmes laying his
hand upon the arm of the peajacket

yes have been dragging the serpentine

in heavens name what for

in search of the body of lady st simon

sherlock holmes leaned back in his chair and laughed heartily

have you dragged the basin of trafalgar square fountain he
asked

why what do you mean

because you have just as good chance of finding this lady in
the one as in the other

lestrade shot an angry glance at my companion suppose you
know all about it he snarled

well have only just heard the facts but my mind is made up

oh indeed then you think that the serpentine plays no part in
the matter

think it very unlikely

then perhaps you will kindly explain how it is that we found
this in it he opened his bag as he spoke and tumbled onto the
floor weddingdress of watered silk pair of white satin
shoes and brides wreath and veil all discoloured and soaked
in water there said he putting new weddingring upon the
top of the pile there is little nut for you to crack master
holmes

oh indeed said my friend blowing blue rings into the air
you dragged them from the serpentine

no they were found floating near the margin by parkkeeper
they have been identified as her clothes and it seemed to me
that if the clothes were there the body would not be far off

by the same brilliant reasoning every mans body is to be found
in the neighbourhood of his wardrobe and pray what did you hope
to arrive at through this

at some evidence implicating flora millar in the disappearance

am afraid that you will find it difficult

are you indeed now cried lestrade with some bitterness
am afraid holmes that you are not very practical with your
deductions and your inferences you have made two blunders in as
many minutes this dress does implicate miss flora millar

and how

in the dress is pocket in the pocket is cardcase in the
cardcase is note and here is the very note he slapped it
down upon the table in front of him listen to this you will
see me when all is ready come at once fhm now my theory all
along has been that lady st simon was decoyed away by flora
millar and that she with confederates no doubt was
responsible for her disappearance here signed with her
initials is the very note which was no doubt quietly slipped
into her hand at the door and which lured her within their
reach

very good lestrade said holmes laughing you really are
very fine indeed let me see it he took up the paper in
listless way but his attention instantly became riveted and he
gave little cry of satisfaction this is indeed important
said he

ha you find it so

extremely so congratulate you warmly

lestrade rose in his triumph and bent his head to look why he
shrieked youre looking at the wrong side

on the contrary this is the right side

the right side youre mad here is the note written in pencil
over here

and over here is what appears to be the fragment of hotel
bill which interests me deeply

theres nothing in it looked at it before said lestrade
oct rooms breakfast cocktail lunch
glass sherry see nothing in that

very likely not it is most important all the same as to the
note it is important also or at least the initials are so
congratulate you again

ive wasted time enough said lestrade rising believe in
hard work and not in sitting by the fire spinning fine theories
goodday mr holmes and we shall see which gets to the bottom
of the matter first he gathered up the garments thrust them
into the bag and made for the door

just one hint to you lestrade drawled holmes before his rival
vanished will tell you the true solution of the matter lady
st simon is myth there is not and there never has been any
such person

lestrade looked sadly at my companion then he turned to me
tapped his forehead three times shook his head solemnly and
hurried away

he had hardly shut the door behind him when holmes rose to put on
his overcoat there is something in what the fellow says about
outdoor work he remarked so think watson that must
leave you to your papers for little

it was after five oclock when sherlock holmes left me but had
no time to be lonely for within an hour there arrived
confectioners man with very large flat box this he unpacked
with the help of youth whom he had brought with him and
presently to my very great astonishment quite epicurean
little cold supper began to be laid out upon our humble
lodginghouse mahogany there were couple of brace of cold
woodcock pheasant de foie gras pie with group of
ancient and cobwebby bottles having laid out all these luxuries
my two visitors vanished away like the genii of the arabian
nights with no explanation save that the things had been paid
for and were ordered to this address

just before nine oclock sherlock holmes stepped briskly into the
room his features were gravely set but there was light in his
eye which made me think that he had not been disappointed in his
conclusions

they have laid the supper then he said rubbing his hands

you seem to expect company they have laid for five

yes fancy we may have some company dropping in said he
am surprised that lord st simon has not already arrived ha
fancy that hear his step now upon the stairs

it was indeed our visitor of the afternoon who came bustling in
dangling his glasses more vigorously than ever and with very
perturbed expression upon his aristocratic features

my messenger reached you then asked holmes

yes and confess that the contents startled me beyond measure
have you good authority for what you say

the best possible

lord st simon sank into chair and passed his hand over his
forehead

what will the duke say he murmured when he hears that one of
the family has been subjected to such humiliation

it is the purest accident cannot allow that there is any
humiliation

ah you look on these things from another standpoint

fail to see that anyone is to blame can hardly see how the
lady could have acted otherwise though her abrupt method of
doing it was undoubtedly to be regretted having no mother she
had no one to advise her at such crisis

it was slight sir public slight said lord st simon
tapping his fingers upon the table

you must make allowance for this poor girl placed in so
unprecedented position

will make no allowance am very angry indeed and have
been shamefully used

think that heard ring said holmes yes there are steps
on the landing if cannot persuade you to take lenient view
of the matter lord st simon have brought an advocate here
who may be more successful he opened the door and ushered in
lady and gentleman lord st simon said he allow me to
introduce you to mr and mrs francis hay moulton the lady
think you have already met

at the sight of these newcomers our client had sprung from his
seat and stood very erect with his eyes cast down and his hand
thrust into the breast of his frockcoat picture of offended
dignity the lady had taken quick step forward and had held out
her hand to him but he still refused to raise his eyes it was
as well for his resolution perhaps for her pleading face was
one which it was hard to resist

youre angry robert said she well guess you have every
cause to be

pray make no apology to me said lord st simon bitterly

oh yes know that have treated you real bad and that
should have spoken to you before went but was kind of
rattled and from the time when saw frank here again just
didnt know what was doing or saying only wonder didnt
fall down and do faint right there before the altar

perhaps mrs moulton you would like my friend and me to leave
the room while you explain this matter

if may give an opinion remarked the strange gentleman
weve had just little too much secrecy over this business
already for my part should like all europe and america to
hear the rights of it he was small wiry sunburnt man
cleanshaven with sharp face and alert manner

then ill tell our story right away said the lady frank here
and met in in mcquires camp near the rockies where pa
was working claim we were engaged to each other frank and
but then one day father struck rich pocket and made pile
while poor frank here had claim that petered out and came to
nothing the richer pa grew the poorer was frank so at last pa
wouldnt hear of our engagement lasting any longer and he took
me away to frisco frank wouldnt throw up his hand though so
he followed me there and he saw me without pa knowing anything
about it it would only have made him mad to know so we just
fixed it all up for ourselves frank said that he would go and
make his pile too and never come back to claim me until he had
as much as pa so then promised to wait for him to the end of
time and pledged myself not to marry anyone else while he lived
why shouldnt we be married right away then said he and
then will feel sure of you and wont claim to be your
husband until come back well we talked it over and he had
fixed it all up so nicely with clergyman all ready in waiting
that we just did it right there and then frank went off to seek
his fortune and went back to pa

the next heard of frank was that he was in montana and then
he went prospecting in arizona and then heard of him from new
mexico after that came long newspaper story about how
miners camp had been attacked by apache indians and there was
my franks name among the killed fainted dead away and was
very sick for months after pa thought had decline and took
me to half the doctors in frisco not word of news came for
year and more so that never doubted that frank was really
dead then lord st simon came to frisco and we came to london
and marriage was arranged and pa was very pleased but felt
all the time that no man on this earth would ever take the place
in my heart that had been given to my poor frank

still if had married lord st simon of course id have done
my duty by him we cant command our love but we can our
actions went to the altar with him with the intention to make
him just as good wife as it was in me to be but you may
imagine what felt when just as came to the altar rails
glanced back and saw frank standing and looking at me out of the
first pew thought it was his ghost at first but when looked
again there he was still with kind of question in his eyes as
if to ask me whether were glad or sorry to see him wonder
didnt drop know that everything was turning round and the
words of the clergyman were just like the buzz of bee in my
ear didnt know what to do should stop the service and make
scene in the church glanced at him again and he seemed to
know what was thinking for he raised his finger to his lips to
tell me to be still then saw him scribble on piece of paper
and knew that he was writing me note as passed his pew on
the way out dropped my bouquet over to him and he slipped the
note into my hand when he returned me the flowers it was only
line asking me to join him when he made the sign to me to do so
of course never doubted for moment that my first duty was now
to him and determined to do just whatever he might direct

when got back told my maid who had known him in california
and had always been his friend ordered her to say nothing but
to get few things packed and my ulster ready know ought to
have spoken to lord st simon but it was dreadful hard before
his mother and all those great people just made up my mind to
run away and explain afterwards hadnt been at the table ten
minutes before saw frank out of the window at the other side of
the road he beckoned to me and then began walking into the park
slipped out put on my things and followed him some woman
came talking something or other about lord st simon to
meseemed to me from the little heard as if he had little
secret of his own before marriage alsobut managed to get away
from her and soon overtook frank we got into cab together and
away we drove to some lodgings he had taken in gordon square and
that was my true wedding after all those years of waiting frank
had been prisoner among the apaches had escaped came on to
frisco found that had given him up for dead and had gone to
england followed me there and had come upon me at last on the
very morning of my second wedding

saw it in paper explained the american it gave the name
and the church but not where the lady lived

then we had talk as to what we should do and frank was all
for openness but was so ashamed of it all that felt as if
should like to vanish away and never see any of them againjust
sending line to pa perhaps to show him that was alive it
was awful to me to think of all those lords and ladies sitting
round that breakfasttable and waiting for me to come back so
frank took my weddingclothes and things and made bundle of
them so that should not be traced and dropped them away
somewhere where no one could find them it is likely that we
should have gone on to paris tomorrow only that this good
gentleman mr holmes came round to us this evening though how
he found us is more than can think and he showed us very
clearly and kindly that was wrong and that frank was right and
that we should be putting ourselves in the wrong if we were so
secret then he offered to give us chance of talking to lord
st simon alone and so we came right away round to his rooms at
once now robert you have heard it all and am very sorry if
have given you pain and hope that you do not think very
meanly of me

lord st simon had by no means relaxed his rigid attitude but
had listened with frowning brow and compressed lip to this
long narrative

excuse me he said but it is not my custom to discuss my most
intimate personal affairs in this public manner

then you wont forgive me you wont shake hands before go

oh certainly if it would give you any pleasure he put out
his hand and coldly grasped that which she extended to him

had hoped suggested holmes that you would have joined us
in friendly supper

think that there you ask little too much responded his
lordship may be forced to acquiesce in these recent
developments but can hardly be expected to make merry over
them think that with your permission will now wish you all
very goodnight he included us all in sweeping bow and
stalked out of the room

then trust that you at least will honour me with your
company said sherlock holmes it is always joy to meet an
american mr moulton for am one of those who believe that the
folly of monarch and the blundering of minister in fargone
years will not prevent our children from being some day citizens
of the same worldwide country under flag which shall be
quartering of the union jack with the stars and stripes

the case has been an interesting one remarked holmes when our
visitors had left us because it serves to show very clearly how
simple the explanation may be of an affair which at first sight
seems to be almost inexplicable nothing could be more natural
than the sequence of events as narrated by this lady and nothing
stranger than the result when viewed for instance by mr
lestrade of scotland yard

you were not yourself at fault at all then

from the first two facts were very obvious to me the one that
the lady had been quite willing to undergo the wedding ceremony
the other that she had repented of it within few minutes of
returning home obviously something had occurred during the
morning then to cause her to change her mind what could that
something be she could not have spoken to anyone when she was
out for she had been in the company of the bridegroom had she
seen someone then if she had it must be someone from america
because she had spent so short time in this country that she
could hardly have allowed anyone to acquire so deep an influence
over her that the mere sight of him would induce her to change
her plans so completely you see we have already arrived by
process of exclusion at the idea that she might have seen an
american then who could this american be and why should he
possess so much influence over her it might be lover it might
be husband her young womanhood had knew been spent in
rough scenes and under strange conditions so far had got
before ever heard lord st simons narrative when he told us
of man in pew of the change in the brides manner of so
transparent device for obtaining note as the dropping of
bouquet of her resort to her confidential maid and of her very
significant allusion to claimjumpingwhich in miners parlance
means taking possession of that which another person has prior
claim tothe whole situation became absolutely clear she had
gone off with man and the man was either lover or was
previous husbandthe chances being in favour of the latter

and how in the world did you find them

it might have been difficult but friend lestrade held
information in his hands the value of which he did not himself
know the initials were of course of the highest importance
but more valuable still was it to know that within week he had
settled his bill at one of the most select london hotels

how did you deduce the select

by the select prices eight shillings for bed and eightpence
for glass of sherry pointed to one of the most expensive
hotels there are not many in london which charge at that rate
in the second one which visited in northumberland avenue
learned by an inspection of the book that francis moulton an
american gentleman had left only the day before and on looking
over the entries against him came upon the very items which
had seen in the duplicate bill his letters were to be forwarded
to gordon square so thither travelled and being fortunate
enough to find the loving couple at home ventured to give them
some paternal advice and to point out to them that it would be
better in every way that they should make their position little
clearer both to the general public and to lord st simon in
particular invited them to meet him here and as you see
made him keep the appointment

but with no very good result remarked his conduct was
certainly not very gracious

ah watson said holmes smiling perhaps you would not be
very gracious either if after all the trouble of wooing and
wedding you found yourself deprived in an instant of wife and of
fortune think that we may judge lord st simon very mercifully
and thank our stars that we are never likely to find ourselves in
the same position draw your chair up and hand me my violin for
the only problem we have still to solve is how to while away
these bleak autumnal evenings



xi the adventure of the beryl coronet

holmes said as stood one morning in our bowwindow looking
down the street here is madman coming along it seems rather
sad that his relatives should allow him to come out alone

my friend rose lazily from his armchair and stood with his hands
in the pockets of his dressinggown looking over my shoulder it
was bright crisp february morning and the snow of the day
before still lay deep upon the ground shimmering brightly in the
wintry sun down the centre of baker street it had been ploughed
into brown crumbly band by the traffic but at either side and
on the heapedup edges of the footpaths it still lay as white as
when it fell the grey pavement had been cleaned and scraped but
was still dangerously slippery so that there were fewer
passengers than usual indeed from the direction of the
metropolitan station no one was coming save the single gentleman
whose eccentric conduct had drawn my attention

he was man of about fifty tall portly and imposing with
massive strongly marked face and commanding figure he was
dressed in sombre yet rich style in black frockcoat shining
hat neat brown gaiters and wellcut pearlgrey trousers yet
his actions were in absurd contrast to the dignity of his dress
and features for he was running hard with occasional little
springs such as weary man gives who is little accustomed to
set any tax upon his legs as he ran he jerked his hands up and
down waggled his head and writhed his face into the most
extraordinary contortions

what on earth can be the matter with him asked he is
looking up at the numbers of the houses

believe that he is coming here said holmes rubbing his
hands

here

yes rather think he is coming to consult me professionally
think that recognise the symptoms ha did not tell you as
he spoke the man puffing and blowing rushed at our door and
pulled at our bell until the whole house resounded with the
clanging

few moments later he was in our room still puffing still
gesticulating but with so fixed look of grief and despair in
his eyes that our smiles were turned in an instant to horror and
pity for while he could not get his words out but swayed his
body and plucked at his hair like one who has been driven to the
extreme limits of his reason then suddenly springing to his
feet he beat his head against the wall with such force that we
both rushed upon him and tore him away to the centre of the room
sherlock holmes pushed him down into the easychair and sitting
beside him patted his hand and chatted with him in the easy
soothing tones which he knew so well how to employ

you have come to me to tell your story have you not said he
you are fatigued with your haste pray wait until you have
recovered yourself and then shall be most happy to look into
any little problem which you may submit to me

the man sat for minute or more with heaving chest fighting
against his emotion then he passed his handkerchief over his
brow set his lips tight and turned his face towards us

no doubt you think me mad said he

see that you have had some great trouble responded holmes

god knows havea trouble which is enough to unseat my
reason so sudden and so terrible is it public disgrace might
have faced although am man whose character has never yet
borne stain private affliction also is the lot of every man
but the two coming together and in so frightful form have
been enough to shake my very soul besides it is not alone
the very noblest in the land may suffer unless some way be found
out of this horrible affair

pray compose yourself sir said holmes and let me have
clear account of who you are and what it is that has befallen
you

my name answered our visitor is probably familiar to your
ears am alexander holder of the banking firm of holder
stevenson of threadneedle street

the name was indeed well known to us as belonging to the senior
partner in the second largest private banking concern in the city
of london what could have happened then to bring one of the
foremost citizens of london to this most pitiable pass we
waited all curiosity until with another effort he braced
himself to tell his story

feel that time is of value said he that is why hastened
here when the police inspector suggested that should secure
your cooperation came to baker street by the underground and
hurried from there on foot for the cabs go slowly through this
snow that is why was so out of breath for am man who
takes very little exercise feel better now and will put the
facts before you as shortly and yet as clearly as can

it is of course well known to you that in successful banking
business as much depends upon our being able to find remunerative
investments for our funds as upon our increasing our connection
and the number of our depositors one of our most lucrative means
of laying out money is in the shape of loans where the security
is unimpeachable we have done good deal in this direction
during the last few years and there are many noble families to
whom we have advanced large sums upon the security of their
pictures libraries or plate

yesterday morning was seated in my office at the bank when
card was brought in to me by one of the clerks started when
saw the name for it was that of none other thanwell perhaps
even to you had better say no more than that it was name
which is household word all over the earthone of the highest
noblest most exalted names in england was overwhelmed by the
honour and attempted when he entered to say so but he plunged
at once into business with the air of man who wishes to hurry
quickly through disagreeable task

mr holder said he have been informed that you are in the
habit of advancing money

the firm does so when the security is good answered

it is absolutely essential to me said he that should have
pounds at once could of course borrow so trifling
sum ten times over from my friends but much prefer to make it
matter of business and to carry out that business myself in my
position you can readily understand that it is unwise to place
ones self under obligations

for how long may ask do you want this sum asked

next monday have large sum due to me and shall then most
certainly repay what you advance with whatever interest you
think it right to charge but it is very essential to me that the
money should be paid at once

should be happy to advance it without further parley from my
own private purse said were it not that the strain would be
rather more than it could bear if on the other hand am to do
it in the name of the firm then in justice to my partner must
insist that even in your case every businesslike precaution
should be taken

should much prefer to have it so said he raising up
square black morocco case which he had laid beside his chair
you have doubtless heard of the beryl coronet

one of the most precious public possessions of the empire
said

precisely he opened the case and there imbedded in soft
fleshcoloured velvet lay the magnificent piece of jewellery
which he had named there are thirtynine enormous beryls said
he and the price of the gold chasing is incalculable the
lowest estimate would put the worth of the coronet at double the
sum which have asked am prepared to leave it with you as my
security

took the precious case into my hands and looked in some
perplexity from it to my illustrious client

you doubt its value he asked

not at all only doubt

the propriety of my leaving it you may set your mind at rest
about that should not dream of doing so were it not absolutely
certain that should be able in four days to reclaim it it is
pure matter of form is the security sufficient

ample

you understand mr holder that am giving you strong proof
of the confidence which have in you founded upon all that
have heard of you rely upon you not only to be discreet and to
refrain from all gossip upon the matter but above all to
preserve this coronet with every possible precaution because
need not say that great public scandal would be caused if any
harm were to befall it any injury to it would be almost as
serious as its complete loss for there are no beryls in the
world to match these and it would be impossible to replace them
leave it with you however with every confidence and shall
call for it in person on monday morning

seeing that my client was anxious to leave said no more but
calling for my cashier ordered him to pay over fifty
pound notes when was alone once more however with the
precious case lying upon the table in front of me could not
but think with some misgivings of the immense responsibility
which it entailed upon me there could be no doubt that as it
was national possession horrible scandal would ensue if any
misfortune should occur to it already regretted having ever
consented to take charge of it however it was too late to alter
the matter now so locked it up in my private safe and turned
once more to my work

when evening came felt that it would be an imprudence to leave
so precious thing in the office behind me bankers safes had
been forced before now and why should not mine be if so how
terrible would be the position in which should find myself
determined therefore that for the next few days would always
carry the case backward and forward with me so that it might
never be really out of my reach with this intention called
cab and drove out to my house at streatham carrying the jewel
with me did not breathe freely until had taken it upstairs
and locked it in the bureau of my dressingroom

and now word as to my household mr holmes for wish you to
thoroughly understand the situation my groom and my page sleep
out of the house and may be set aside altogether have three
maidservants who have been with me number of years and whose
absolute reliability is quite above suspicion another lucy
parr the second waitingmaid has only been in my service few
months she came with an excellent character however and has
always given me satisfaction she is very pretty girl and has
attracted admirers who have occasionally hung about the place
that is the only drawback which we have found to her but we
believe her to be thoroughly good girl in every way

so much for the servants my family itself is so small that it
will not take me long to describe it am widower and have an
only son arthur he has been disappointment to me mr
holmesa grievous disappointment have no doubt that am
myself to blame people tell me that have spoiled him very
likely have when my dear wife died felt that he was all
had to love could not bear to see the smile fade even for
moment from his face have never denied him wish perhaps it
would have been better for both of us had been sterner but
meant it for the best

it was naturally my intention that he should succeed me in my
business but he was not of business turn he was wild
wayward and to speak the truth could not trust him in the
handling of large sums of money when he was young he became
member of an aristocratic club and there having charming
manners he was soon the intimate of number of men with long
purses and expensive habits he learned to play heavily at cards
and to squander money on the turf until he had again and again
to come to me and implore me to give him an advance upon his
allowance that he might settle his debts of honour he tried
more than once to break away from the dangerous company which he
was keeping but each time the influence of his friend sir
george burnwell was enough to draw him back again

and indeed could not wonder that such man as sir george
burnwell should gain an influence over him for he has frequently
brought him to my house and have found myself that could
hardly resist the fascination of his manner he is older than
arthur man of the world to his fingertips one who had been
everywhere seen everything brilliant talker and man of
great personal beauty yet when think of him in cold blood far
away from the glamour of his presence am convinced from his
cynical speech and the look which have caught in his eyes that
he is one who should be deeply distrusted so think and so
too thinks my little mary who has womans quick insight into
character

and now there is only she to be described she is my niece but
when my brother died five years ago and left her alone in the
world adopted her and have looked upon her ever since as my
daughter she is sunbeam in my housesweet loving beautiful
wonderful manager and housekeeper yet as tender and quiet and
gentle as woman could be she is my right hand do not know
what could do without her in only one matter has she ever gone
against my wishes twice my boy has asked her to marry him for
he loves her devotedly but each time she has refused him
think that if anyone could have drawn him into the right path it
would have been she and that his marriage might have changed his
whole life but now alas it is too lateforever too late

now mr holmes you know the people who live under my roof and
shall continue with my miserable story

when we were taking coffee in the drawingroom that night after
dinner told arthur and mary my experience and of the precious
treasure which we had under our roof suppressing only the name
of my client lucy parr who had brought in the coffee had am
sure left the room but cannot swear that the door was closed
mary and arthur were much interested and wished to see the famous
coronet but thought it better not to disturb it

where have you put it asked arthur

in my own bureau

well hope to goodness the house wont be burgled during the
night said he

it is locked up answered

oh any old key will fit that bureau when was youngster
have opened it myself with the key of the boxroom cupboard

he often had wild way of talking so that thought little of
what he said he followed me to my room however that night with
very grave face

look here dad said he with his eyes cast down can you let
me have pounds

no cannot answered sharply have been far too
generous with you in money matters

you have been very kind said he but must have this money
or else can never show my face inside the club again

and very good thing too cried

yes but you would not have me leave it dishonoured man
said he could not bear the disgrace must raise the money
in some way and if you will not let me have it then must try
other means

was very angry for this was the third demand during the
month you shall not have farthing from me cried on which
he bowed and left the room without another word

when he was gone unlocked my bureau made sure that my
treasure was safe and locked it again then started to go
round the house to see that all was securea duty which
usually leave to mary but which thought it well to perform
myself that night as came down the stairs saw mary herself
at the side window of the hall which she closed and fastened as
approached

tell me dad said she looking thought little
disturbed did you give lucy the maid leave to go out
tonight

certainly not

she came in just now by the back door have no doubt that she
has only been to the side gate to see someone but think that
it is hardly safe and should be stopped

you must speak to her in the morning or will if you prefer
it are you sure that everything is fastened

quite sure dad

then goodnight kissed her and went up to my bedroom
again where was soon asleep

am endeavouring to tell you everything mr holmes which may
have any bearing upon the case but beg that you will question
me upon any point which do not make clear

on the contrary your statement is singularly lucid

come to part of my story now in which should wish to be
particularly so am not very heavy sleeper and the anxiety
in my mind tended no doubt to make me even less so than usual
about two in the morning then was awakened by some sound in
the house it had ceased ere was wide awake but it had left an
impression behind it as though window had gently closed
somewhere lay listening with all my ears suddenly to my
horror there was distinct sound of footsteps moving softly in
the next room slipped out of bed all palpitating with fear
and peeped round the corner of my dressingroom door

arthur screamed you villain you thief how dare you
touch that coronet

the gas was half up as had left it and my unhappy boy
dressed only in his shirt and trousers was standing beside the
light holding the coronet in his hands he appeared to be
wrenching at it or bending it with all his strength at my cry
he dropped it from his grasp and turned as pale as death
snatched it up and examined it one of the gold corners with
three of the beryls in it was missing

you blackguard shouted beside myself with rage you have
destroyed it you have dishonoured me forever where are the
jewels which you have stolen

stolen he cried

yes thief roared shaking him by the shoulder

there are none missing there cannot be any missing said he

there are three missing and you know where they are must
call you liar as well as thief did not see you trying to
tear off another piece

you have called me names enough said he will not stand it
any longer shall not say another word about this business
since you have chosen to insult me will leave your house in
the morning and make my own way in the world

you shall leave it in the hands of the police cried
halfmad with grief and rage shall have this matter probed to
the bottom

you shall learn nothing from me said he with passion such
as should not have thought was in his nature if you choose to
call the police let the police find what they can

by this time the whole house was astir for had raised my
voice in my anger mary was the first to rush into my room and
at the sight of the coronet and of arthurs face she read the
whole story and with scream fell down senseless on the
ground sent the housemaid for the police and put the
investigation into their hands at once when the inspector and
constable entered the house arthur who had stood sullenly with
his arms folded asked me whether it was my intention to charge
him with theft answered that it had ceased to be private
matter but had become public one since the ruined coronet was
national property was determined that the law should have its
way in everything

at least said he you will not have me arrested at once it
would be to your advantage as well as mine if might leave the
house for five minutes

that you may get away or perhaps that you may conceal what you
have stolen said and then realising the dreadful position
in which was placed implored him to remember that not only
my honour but that of one who was far greater than was at
stake and that he threatened to raise scandal which would
convulse the nation he might avert it all if he would but tell
me what he had done with the three missing stones

you may as well face the matter said you have been caught
in the act and no confession could make your guilt more heinous
if you but make such reparation as is in your power by telling
us where the beryls are all shall be forgiven and forgotten

keep your forgiveness for those who ask for it he answered
turning away from me with sneer saw that he was too hardened
for any words of mine to influence him there was but one way for
it called in the inspector and gave him into custody search
was made at once not only of his person but of his room and of
every portion of the house where he could possibly have concealed
the gems but no trace of them could be found nor would the
wretched boy open his mouth for all our persuasions and our
threats this morning he was removed to cell and after
going through all the police formalities have hurried round to
you to implore you to use your skill in unravelling the matter
the police have openly confessed that they can at present make
nothing of it you may go to any expense which you think
necessary have already offered reward of pounds my
god what shall do have lost my honour my gems and my son
in one night oh what shall do

he put hand on either side of his head and rocked himself to
and fro droning to himself like child whose grief has got
beyond words

sherlock holmes sat silent for some few minutes with his brows
knitted and his eyes fixed upon the fire

do you receive much company he asked

none save my partner with his family and an occasional friend of
arthurs sir george burnwell has been several times lately no
one else think

do you go out much in society

arthur does mary and stay at home we neither of us care for
it

that is unusual in young girl

she is of quiet nature besides she is not so very young she
is fourandtwenty

this matter from what you say seems to have been shock to
her also

terrible she is even more affected than

you have neither of you any doubt as to your sons guilt

how can we have when saw him with my own eyes with the coronet
in his hands

hardly consider that conclusive proof was the remainder of
the coronet at all injured

yes it was twisted

do you not think then that he might have been trying to
straighten it

god bless you you are doing what you can for him and for me
but it is too heavy task what was he doing there at all if
his purpose were innocent why did he not say so

precisely and if it were guilty why did he not invent lie
his silence appears to me to cut both ways there are several
singular points about the case what did the police think of the
noise which awoke you from your sleep

they considered that it might be caused by arthurs closing his
bedroom door

likely story as if man bent on felony would slam his door
so as to wake household what did they say then of the
disappearance of these gems

they are still sounding the planking and probing the furniture
in the hope of finding them

have they thought of looking outside the house

yes they have shown extraordinary energy the whole garden has
already been minutely examined

now my dear sir said holmes is it not obvious to you now
that this matter really strikes very much deeper than either you
or the police were at first inclined to think it appeared to you
to be simple case to me it seems exceedingly complex consider
what is involved by your theory you suppose that your son came
down from his bed went at great risk to your dressingroom
opened your bureau took out your coronet broke off by main
force small portion of it went off to some other place
concealed three gems out of the thirtynine with such skill that
nobody can find them and then returned with the other thirtysix
into the room in which he exposed himself to the greatest danger
of being discovered ask you now is such theory tenable

but what other is there cried the banker with gesture of
despair if his motives were innocent why does he not explain
them

it is our task to find that out replied holmes so now if
you please mr holder we will set off for streatham together
and devote an hour to glancing little more closely into
details

my friend insisted upon my accompanying them in their expedition
which was eager enough to do for my curiosity and sympathy
were deeply stirred by the story to which we had listened
confess that the guilt of the bankers son appeared to me to be
as obvious as it did to his unhappy father but still had such
faith in holmes judgment that felt that there must be some
grounds for hope as long as he was dissatisfied with the accepted
explanation he hardly spoke word the whole way out to the
southern suburb but sat with his chin upon his breast and his
hat drawn over his eyes sunk in the deepest thought our client
appeared to have taken fresh heart at the little glimpse of hope
which had been presented to him and he even broke into
desultory chat with me over his business affairs short railway
journey and shorter walk brought us to fairbank the modest
residence of the great financier

fairbank was goodsized square house of white stone standing
back little from the road double carriagesweep with
snowclad lawn stretched down in front to two large iron gates
which closed the entrance on the right side was small wooden
thicket which led into narrow path between two neat hedges
stretching from the road to the kitchen door and forming the
tradesmens entrance on the left ran lane which led to the
stables and was not itself within the grounds at all being
public though little used thoroughfare holmes left us standing
at the door and walked slowly all round the house across the
front down the tradesmens path and so round by the garden
behind into the stable lane so long was he that mr holder and
went into the diningroom and waited by the fire until he should
return we were sitting there in silence when the door opened and
young lady came in she was rather above the middle height
slim with dark hair and eyes which seemed the darker against
the absolute pallor of her skin do not think that have ever
seen such deadly paleness in womans face her lips too were
bloodless but her eyes were flushed with crying as she swept
silently into the room she impressed me with greater sense of
grief than the banker had done in the morning and it was the
more striking in her as she was evidently woman of strong
character with immense capacity for selfrestraint disregarding
my presence she went straight to her uncle and passed her hand
over his head with sweet womanly caress

you have given orders that arthur should be liberated have you
not dad she asked

no no my girl the matter must be probed to the bottom

but am so sure that he is innocent you know what womans
instincts are know that he has done no harm and that you will
be sorry for having acted so harshly

why is he silent then if he is innocent

who knows perhaps because he was so angry that you should
suspect him

how could help suspecting him when actually saw him with
the coronet in his hand

oh but he had only picked it up to look at it oh do do take
my word for it that he is innocent let the matter drop and say
no more it is so dreadful to think of our dear arthur in
prison

shall never let it drop until the gems are foundnever mary
your affection for arthur blinds you as to the awful consequences
to me far from hushing the thing up have brought gentleman
down from london to inquire more deeply into it

this gentleman she asked facing round to me

no his friend he wished us to leave him alone he is round in
the stable lane now

the stable lane she raised her dark eyebrows what can he
hope to find there ah this suppose is he trust sir
that you will succeed in proving what feel sure is the truth
that my cousin arthur is innocent of this crime

fully share your opinion and trust with you that we may
prove it returned holmes going back to the mat to knock the
snow from his shoes believe have the honour of addressing
miss mary holder might ask you question or two

pray do sir if it may help to clear this horrible affair up

you heard nothing yourself last night

nothing until my uncle here began to speak loudly heard
that and came down

you shut up the windows and doors the night before did you
fasten all the windows

yes

were they all fastened this morning

yes

you have maid who has sweetheart think that you remarked
to your uncle last night that she had been out to see him

yes and she was the girl who waited in the drawingroom and
who may have heard uncles remarks about the coronet

see you infer that she may have gone out to tell her
sweetheart and that the two may have planned the robbery

but what is the good of all these vague theories cried the
banker impatiently when have told you that saw arthur with
the coronet in his hands

wait little mr holder we must come back to that about this
girl miss holder you saw her return by the kitchen door
presume

yes when went to see if the door was fastened for the night
met her slipping in saw the man too in the gloom

do you know him

oh yes he is the greengrocer who brings our vegetables round
his name is francis prosper

he stood said holmes to the left of the doorthat is to
say farther up the path than is necessary to reach the door

yes he did

and he is man with wooden leg

something like fear sprang up in the young ladys expressive
black eyes why you are like magician said she how do you
know that she smiled but there was no answering smile in
holmes thin eager face

should be very glad now to go upstairs said he shall
probably wish to go over the outside of the house again perhaps
had better take look at the lower windows before go up

he walked swiftly round from one to the other pausing only at
the large one which looked from the hall onto the stable lane
this he opened and made very careful examination of the sill
with his powerful magnifying lens now we shall go upstairs
said he at last

the bankers dressingroom was plainly furnished little
chamber with grey carpet large bureau and long mirror
holmes went to the bureau first and looked hard at the lock

which key was used to open it he asked

that which my son himself indicatedthat of the cupboard of the
lumberroom

have you it here

that is it on the dressingtable

sherlock holmes took it up and opened the bureau

it is noiseless lock said he it is no wonder that it did
not wake you this case presume contains the coronet we must
have look at it he opened the case and taking out the diadem
he laid it upon the table it was magnificent specimen of the
jewellers art and the thirtysix stones were the finest that
have ever seen at one side of the coronet was cracked edge
where corner holding three gems had been torn away

now mr holder said holmes here is the corner which
corresponds to that which has been so unfortunately lost might
beg that you will break it off

the banker recoiled in horror should not dream of trying
said he

then will holmes suddenly bent his strength upon it but
without result feel it give little said he but though
am exceptionally strong in the fingers it would take me all my
time to break it an ordinary man could not do it now what do
you think would happen if did break it mr holder there would
be noise like pistol shot do you tell me that all this
happened within few yards of your bed and that you heard
nothing of it

do not know what to think it is all dark to me

but perhaps it may grow lighter as we go what do you think
miss holder

confess that still share my uncles perplexity

your son had no shoes or slippers on when you saw him

he had nothing on save only his trousers and shirt

thank you we have certainly been favoured with extraordinary
luck during this inquiry and it will be entirely our own fault
if we do not succeed in clearing the matter up with your
permission mr holder shall now continue my investigations
outside

he went alone at his own request for he explained that any
unnecessary footmarks might make his task more difficult for an
hour or more he was at work returning at last with his feet
heavy with snow and his features as inscrutable as ever

think that have seen now all that there is to see mr
holder said he can serve you best by returning to my
rooms

but the gems mr holmes where are they

cannot tell

the banker wrung his hands shall never see them again he
cried and my son you give me hopes

my opinion is in no way altered

then for gods sake what was this dark business which was
acted in my house last night

if you can call upon me at my baker street rooms tomorrow
morning between nine and ten shall be happy to do what can to
make it clearer understand that you give me carte blanche to
act for you provided only that get back the gems and that you
place no limit on the sum may draw

would give my fortune to have them back

very good shall look into the matter between this and then
goodbye it is just possible that may have to come over here
again before evening

it was obvious to me that my companions mind was now made up
about the case although what his conclusions were was more than
could even dimly imagine several times during our homeward
journey endeavoured to sound him upon the point but he always
glided away to some other topic until at last gave it over in
despair it was not yet three when we found ourselves in our
rooms once more he hurried to his chamber and was down again in
few minutes dressed as common loafer with his collar turned
up his shiny seedy coat his red cravat and his worn boots he
was perfect sample of the class

think that this should do said he glancing into the glass
above the fireplace only wish that you could come with me
watson but fear that it wont do may be on the trail in
this matter or may be following willothewisp but
shall soon know which it is hope that may be back in few
hours he cut slice of beef from the joint upon the sideboard
sandwiched it between two rounds of bread and thrusting this
rude meal into his pocket he started off upon his expedition

had just finished my tea when he returned evidently in
excellent spirits swinging an old elasticsided boot in his
hand he chucked it down into corner and helped himself to
cup of tea

only looked in as passed said he am going right on

where to

oh to the other side of the west end it may be some time
before get back dont wait up for me in case should be
late

how are you getting on

oh so so nothing to complain of have been out to streatham
since saw you last but did not call at the house it is
very sweet little problem and would not have missed it for
good deal however must not sit gossiping here but must get
these disreputable clothes off and return to my highly
respectable self

could see by his manner that he had stronger reasons for
satisfaction than his words alone would imply his eyes twinkled
and there was even touch of colour upon his sallow cheeks he
hastened upstairs and few minutes later heard the slam of
the hall door which told me that he was off once more upon his
congenial hunt

waited until midnight but there was no sign of his return so
retired to my room it was no uncommon thing for him to be away
for days and nights on end when he was hot upon scent so that
his lateness caused me no surprise do not know at what hour he
came in but when came down to breakfast in the morning there
he was with cup of coffee in one hand and the paper in the
other as fresh and trim as possible

you will excuse my beginning without you watson said he but
you remember that our client has rather an early appointment this
morning

why it is after nine now answered should not be
surprised if that were he thought heard ring

it was indeed our friend the financier was shocked by the
change which had come over him for his face which was naturally
of broad and massive mould was now pinched and fallen in
while his hair seemed to me at least shade whiter he entered
with weariness and lethargy which was even more painful than
his violence of the morning before and he dropped heavily into
the armchair which pushed forward for him

do not know what have done to be so severely tried said
he only two days ago was happy and prosperous man without
care in the world now am left to lonely and dishonoured
age one sorrow comes close upon the heels of another my niece
mary has deserted me

deserted you

yes her bed this morning had not been slept in her room was
empty and note for me lay upon the hall table had said to
her last night in sorrow and not in anger that if she had
married my boy all might have been well with him perhaps it was
thoughtless of me to say so it is to that remark that she refers
in this note

my dearest unclei feel that have brought trouble upon you
and that if had acted differently this terrible misfortune
might never have occurred cannot with this thought in my
mind ever again be happy under your roof and feel that must
leave you forever do not worry about my future for that is
provided for and above all do not search for me for it will
be fruitless labour and an illservice to me in life or in
death am ever your lovingmary

what could she mean by that note mr holmes do you think it
points to suicide

no no nothing of the kind it is perhaps the best possible
solution trust mr holder that you are nearing the end of
your troubles

ha you say so you have heard something mr holmes you have
learned something where are the gems

you would not think pounds apiece an excessive sum for
them

would pay ten

that would be unnecessary three thousand will cover the matter
and there is little reward fancy have you your checkbook
here is pen better make it out for pounds

with dazed face the banker made out the required check holmes
walked over to his desk took out little triangular piece of
gold with three gems in it and threw it down upon the table

with shriek of joy our client clutched it up

you have it he gasped am saved am saved

the reaction of joy was as passionate as his grief had been and
he hugged his recovered gems to his bosom

there is one other thing you owe mr holder said sherlock
holmes rather sternly

owe he caught up pen name the sum and will pay it

no the debt is not to me you owe very humble apology to that
noble lad your son who has carried himself in this matter as
should be proud to see my own son do should ever chance to
have one

then it was not arthur who took them

told you yesterday and repeat today that it was not

you are sure of it then let us hurry to him at once to let him
know that the truth is known

he knows it already when had cleared it all up had an
interview with him and finding that he would not tell me the
story told it to him on which he had to confess that was
right and to add the very few details which were not yet quite
clear to me your news of this morning however may open his
lips

for heavens sake tell me then what is this extraordinary
mystery

will do so and will show you the steps by which reached
it and let me say to you first that which it is hardest for me
to say and for you to hear there has been an understanding
between sir george burnwell and your niece mary they have now
fled together

my mary impossible

it is unfortunately more than possible it is certain neither
you nor your son knew the true character of this man when you
admitted him into your family circle he is one of the most
dangerous men in englanda ruined gambler an absolutely
desperate villain man without heart or conscience your niece
knew nothing of such men when he breathed his vows to her as he
had done to hundred before her she flattered herself that she
alone had touched his heart the devil knows best what he said
but at least she became his tool and was in the habit of seeing
him nearly every evening

cannot and will not believe it cried the banker with an
ashen face

will tell you then what occurred in your house last night
your niece when you had as she thought gone to your room
slipped down and talked to her lover through the window which
leads into the stable lane his footmarks had pressed right
through the snow so long had he stood there she told him of the
coronet his wicked lust for gold kindled at the news and he
bent her to his will have no doubt that she loved you but
there are women in whom the love of lover extinguishes all
other loves and think that she must have been one she had
hardly listened to his instructions when she saw you coming
downstairs on which she closed the window rapidly and told you
about one of the servants escapade with her woodenlegged lover
which was all perfectly true

your boy arthur went to bed after his interview with you but
he slept badly on account of his uneasiness about his club debts
in the middle of the night he heard soft tread pass his door
so he rose and looking out was surprised to see his cousin
walking very stealthily along the passage until she disappeared
into your dressingroom petrified with astonishment the lad
slipped on some clothes and waited there in the dark to see what
would come of this strange affair presently she emerged from the
room again and in the light of the passagelamp your son saw
that she carried the precious coronet in her hands she passed
down the stairs and he thrilling with horror ran along and
slipped behind the curtain near your door whence he could see
what passed in the hall beneath he saw her stealthily open the
window hand out the coronet to someone in the gloom and then
closing it once more hurry back to her room passing quite close
to where he stood hid behind the curtain

as long as she was on the scene he could not take any action
without horrible exposure of the woman whom he loved but the
instant that she was gone he realised how crushing misfortune
this would be for you and how allimportant it was to set it
right he rushed down just as he was in his bare feet opened
the window sprang out into the snow and ran down the lane
where he could see dark figure in the moonlight sir george
burnwell tried to get away but arthur caught him and there was
struggle between them your lad tugging at one side of the
coronet and his opponent at the other in the scuffle your son
struck sir george and cut him over the eye then something
suddenly snapped and your son finding that he had the coronet
in his hands rushed back closed the window ascended to your
room and had just observed that the coronet had been twisted in
the struggle and was endeavouring to straighten it when you
appeared upon the scene

is it possible gasped the banker

you then roused his anger by calling him names at moment when
he felt that he had deserved your warmest thanks he could not
explain the true state of affairs without betraying one who
certainly deserved little enough consideration at his hands he
took the more chivalrous view however and preserved her
secret

and that was why she shrieked and fainted when she saw the
coronet cried mr holder oh my god what blind fool have
been and his asking to be allowed to go out for five minutes
the dear fellow wanted to see if the missing piece were at the
scene of the struggle how cruelly have misjudged him

when arrived at the house continued holmes at once went
very carefully round it to observe if there were any traces in
the snow which might help me knew that none had fallen since
the evening before and also that there had been strong frost
to preserve impressions passed along the tradesmens path but
found it all trampled down and indistinguishable just beyond it
however at the far side of the kitchen door woman had stood
and talked with man whose round impressions on one side showed
that he had wooden leg could even tell that they had been
disturbed for the woman had run back swiftly to the door as was
shown by the deep toe and light heel marks while woodenleg had
waited little and then had gone away thought at the time
that this might be the maid and her sweetheart of whom you had
already spoken to me and inquiry showed it was so passed
round the garden without seeing anything more than random tracks
which took to be the police but when got into the stable
lane very long and complex story was written in the snow in
front of me

there was double line of tracks of booted man and second
double line which saw with delight belonged to man with naked
feet was at once convinced from what you had told me that the
latter was your son the first had walked both ways but the
other had run swiftly and as his tread was marked in places over
the depression of the boot it was obvious that he had passed
after the other followed them up and found they led to the
hall window where boots had worn all the snow away while
waiting then walked to the other end which was hundred
yards or more down the lane saw where boots had faced round
where the snow was cut up as though there had been struggle
and finally where few drops of blood had fallen to show me
that was not mistaken boots had then run down the lane and
another little smudge of blood showed that it was he who had been
hurt when he came to the highroad at the other end found that
the pavement had been cleared so there was an end to that clue

on entering the house however examined as you remember the
sill and framework of the hall window with my lens and could
at once see that someone had passed out could distinguish the
outline of an instep where the wet foot had been placed in coming
in was then beginning to be able to form an opinion as to what
had occurred man had waited outside the window someone had
brought the gems the deed had been overseen by your son he had
pursued the thief had struggled with him they had each tugged
at the coronet their united strength causing injuries which
neither alone could have effected he had returned with the
prize but had left fragment in the grasp of his opponent so
far was clear the question now was who was the man and who
was it brought him the coronet

it is an old maxim of mine that when you have excluded the
impossible whatever remains however improbable must be the
truth now knew that it was not you who had brought it down
so there only remained your niece and the maids but if it were
the maids why should your son allow himself to be accused in
their place there could be no possible reason as he loved his
cousin however there was an excellent explanation why he should
retain her secretthe more so as the secret was disgraceful
one when remembered that you had seen her at that window and
how she had fainted on seeing the coronet again my conjecture
became certainty

and who could it be who was her confederate lover evidently
for who else could outweigh the love and gratitude which she must
feel to you knew that you went out little and that your
circle of friends was very limited one but among them was sir
george burnwell had heard of him before as being man of evil
reputation among women it must have been he who wore those boots
and retained the missing gems even though he knew that arthur
had discovered him he might still flatter himself that he was
safe for the lad could not say word without compromising his
own family

well your own good sense will suggest what measures took
next went in the shape of loafer to sir georges house
managed to pick up an acquaintance with his valet learned that
his master had cut his head the night before and finally at
the expense of six shillings made all sure by buying pair of
his castoff shoes with these journeyed down to streatham and
saw that they exactly fitted the tracks

saw an illdressed vagabond in the lane yesterday evening
said mr holder

precisely it was found that had my man so came home
and changed my clothes it was delicate part which had to
play then for saw that prosecution must be avoided to avert
scandal and knew that so astute villain would see that our
hands were tied in the matter went and saw him at first of
course he denied everything but when gave him every
particular that had occurred he tried to bluster and took down
lifepreserver from the wall knew my man however and
clapped pistol to his head before he could strike then he
became little more reasonable told him that we would give
him price for the stones he pounds apiece that
brought out the first signs of grief that he had shown why
dash it all said he ive let them go at six hundred for the
three soon managed to get the address of the receiver who had
them on promising him that there would be no prosecution off
set to him and after much chaffering got our stones at
pounds apiece then looked in upon your son told him that all
was right and eventually got to my bed about two oclock after
what may call really hard days work

day which has saved england from great public scandal said
the banker rising sir cannot find words to thank you but
you shall not find me ungrateful for what you have done your
skill has indeed exceeded all that have heard of it and now
must fly to my dear boy to apologise to him for the wrong which
have done him as to what you tell me of poor mary it goes to my
very heart not even your skill can inform me where she is now

think that we may safely say returned holmes that she is
wherever sir george burnwell is it is equally certain too that
whatever her sins are they will soon receive more than
sufficient punishment



xii the adventure of the copper beeches

to the man who loves art for its own sake remarked sherlock
holmes tossing aside the advertisement sheet of the daily
telegraph it is frequently in its least important and lowliest
manifestations that the keenest pleasure is to be derived it is
pleasant to me to observe watson that you have so far grasped
this truth that in these little records of our cases which you
have been good enough to draw up and am bound to say
occasionally to embellish you have given prominence not so much
to the many causes and sensational trials in which
have figured but rather to those incidents which may have been
trivial in themselves but which have given room for those
faculties of deduction and of logical synthesis which have made
my special province

and yet said smiling cannot quite hold myself absolved
from the charge of sensationalism which has been urged against my
records

you have erred perhaps he observed taking up glowing
cinder with the tongs and lighting with it the long cherrywood
pipe which was wont to replace his clay when he was in
disputatious rather than meditative moodyou have erred
perhaps in attempting to put colour and life into each of your
statements instead of confining yourself to the task of placing
upon record that severe reasoning from cause to effect which is
really the only notable feature about the thing

it seems to me that have done you full justice in the matter
remarked with some coldness for was repelled by the egotism
which had more than once observed to be strong factor in my
friends singular character

no it is not selfishness or conceit said he answering as
was his wont my thoughts rather than my words if claim full
justice for my art it is because it is an impersonal thinga
thing beyond myself crime is common logic is rare therefore it
is upon the logic rather than upon the crime that you should
dwell you have degraded what should have been course of
lectures into series of tales

it was cold morning of the early spring and we sat after
breakfast on either side of cheery fire in the old room at
baker street thick fog rolled down between the lines of
duncoloured houses and the opposing windows loomed like dark
shapeless blurs through the heavy yellow wreaths our gas was lit
and shone on the white cloth and glimmer of china and metal for
the table had not been cleared yet sherlock holmes had been
silent all the morning dipping continuously into the
advertisement columns of succession of papers until at last
having apparently given up his search he had emerged in no very
sweet temper to lecture me upon my literary shortcomings

at the same time he remarked after pause during which he
had sat puffing at his long pipe and gazing down into the fire
you can hardly be open to charge of sensationalism for out of
these cases which you have been so kind as to interest yourself
in fair proportion do not treat of crime in its legal sense
at all the small matter in which endeavoured to help the king
of bohemia the singular experience of miss mary sutherland the
problem connected with the man with the twisted lip and the
incident of the noble bachelor were all matters which are
outside the pale of the law but in avoiding the sensational
fear that you may have bordered on the trivial

the end may have been so answered but the methods hold
to have been novel and of interest

pshaw my dear fellow what do the public the great unobservant
public who could hardly tell weaver by his tooth or
compositor by his left thumb care about the finer shades of
analysis and deduction but indeed if you are trivial cannot
blame you for the days of the great cases are past man or at
least criminal man has lost all enterprise and originality as
to my own little practice it seems to be degenerating into an
agency for recovering lost lead pencils and giving advice to
young ladies from boardingschools think that have touched
bottom at last however this note had this morning marks my
zeropoint fancy read it he tossed crumpled letter across
to me

it was dated from montague place upon the preceding evening and
ran thus

dear mr holmesi am very anxious to consult you as to whether
should or should not accept situation which has been offered
to me as governess shall call at halfpast ten tomorrow if
do not inconvenience you yours faithfully
violet hunter

do you know the young lady asked

not

it is halfpast ten now

yes and have no doubt that is her ring

it may turn out to be of more interest than you think you
remember that the affair of the blue carbuncle which appeared to
be mere whim at first developed into serious investigation
it may be so in this case also

well let us hope so but our doubts will very soon be solved
for here unless am much mistaken is the person in question

as he spoke the door opened and young lady entered the room
she was plainly but neatly dressed with bright quick face
freckled like plovers egg and with the brisk manner of
woman who has had her own way to make in the world

you will excuse my troubling you am sure said she as my
companion rose to greet her but have had very strange
experience and as have no parents or relations of any sort
from whom could ask advice thought that perhaps you would be
kind enough to tell me what should do

pray take seat miss hunter shall be happy to do anything
that can to serve you

could see that holmes was favourably impressed by the manner
and speech of his new client he looked her over in his searching
fashion and then composed himself with his lids drooping and
his fingertips together to listen to her story

have been governess for five years said she in the
family of colonel spence munro but two months ago the colonel
received an appointment at halifax in nova scotia and took his
children over to america with him so that found myself without
situation advertised and answered advertisements but
without success at last the little money which had saved began
to run short and was at my wits end as to what should do

there is wellknown agency for governesses in the west end
called westaways and there used to call about once week in
order to see whether anything had turned up which might suit me
westaway was the name of the founder of the business but it is
really managed by miss stoper she sits in her own little office
and the ladies who are seeking employment wait in an anteroom
and are then shown in one by one when she consults her ledgers
and sees whether she has anything which would suit them

well when called last week was shown into the little office
as usual but found that miss stoper was not alone
prodigiously stout man with very smiling face and great heavy
chin which rolled down in fold upon fold over his throat sat at
her elbow with pair of glasses on his nose looking very
earnestly at the ladies who entered as came in he gave quite
jump in his chair and turned quickly to miss stoper

that will do said he could not ask for anything better
capital capital he seemed quite enthusiastic and rubbed his
hands together in the most genial fashion he was such
comfortablelooking man that it was quite pleasure to look at
him

you are looking for situation miss he asked

yes sir

as governess

yes sir

and what salary do you ask

had pounds month in my last place with colonel spence
munro

oh tut tut sweatingrank sweating he cried throwing his
fat hands out into the air like man who is in boiling
passion how could anyone offer so pitiful sum to lady with
such attractions and accomplishments

my accomplishments sir may be less than you imagine said
little french little german music and drawing

tut tut he cried this is all quite beside the question
the point is have you or have you not the bearing and deportment
of lady there it is in nutshell if you have not you are
not fitted for the rearing of child who may some day play
considerable part in the history of the country but if you have
why then how could any gentleman ask you to condescend to
accept anything under the three figures your salary with me
madam would commence at pounds year

you may imagine mr holmes that to me destitute as was
such an offer seemed almost too good to be true the gentleman
however seeing perhaps the look of incredulity upon my face
opened pocketbook and took out note

it is also my custom said he smiling in the most pleasant
fashion until his eyes were just two little shining slits amid
the white creases of his face to advance to my young ladies
half their salary beforehand so that they may meet any little
expenses of their journey and their wardrobe

it seemed to me that had never met so fascinating and so
thoughtful man as was already in debt to my tradesmen the
advance was great convenience and yet there was something
unnatural about the whole transaction which made me wish to know
little more before quite committed myself

may ask where you live sir said

hampshire charming rural place the copper beeches five miles
on the far side of winchester it is the most lovely country my
dear young lady and the dearest old countryhouse

and my duties sir should be glad to know what they would
be

one childone dear little romper just six years old oh if
you could see him killing cockroaches with slipper smack
smack smack three gone before you could wink he leaned back
in his chair and laughed his eyes into his head again

was little startled at the nature of the childs amusement
but the fathers laughter made me think that perhaps he was
joking

my sole duties then asked are to take charge of single
child

no no not the sole not the sole my dear young lady he
cried your duty would be as am sure your good sense would
suggest to obey any little commands my wife might give provided
always that they were such commands as lady might with
propriety obey you see no difficulty heh

should be happy to make myself useful

quite so in dress now for example we are faddy people you
knowfaddy but kindhearted if you were asked to wear any dress
which we might give you you would not object to our little whim
heh

no said considerably astonished at his words

or to sit here or sit there that would not be offensive to
you

oh no

or to cut your hair quite short before you come to us

could hardly believe my ears as you may observe mr holmes
my hair is somewhat luxuriant and of rather peculiar tint of
chestnut it has been considered artistic could not dream of
sacrificing it in this offhand fashion

am afraid that that is quite impossible said he had been
watching me eagerly out of his small eyes and could see
shadow pass over his face as spoke

am afraid that it is quite essential said he it is
little fancy of my wifes and ladies fancies you know madam
ladies fancies must be consulted and so you wont cut your
hair

no sir really could not answered firmly

ah very well then that quite settles the matter it is
pity because in other respects you would really have done very
nicely in that case miss stoper had best inspect few more
of your young ladies

the manageress had sat all this while busy with her papers
without word to either of us but she glanced at me now with so
much annoyance upon her face that could not help suspecting
that she had lost handsome commission through my refusal

do you desire your name to be kept upon the books she asked

if you please miss stoper

well really it seems rather useless since you refuse the
most excellent offers in this fashion said she sharply you
can hardly expect us to exert ourselves to find another such
opening for you goodday to you miss hunter she struck gong
upon the table and was shown out by the page

well mr holmes when got back to my lodgings and found
little enough in the cupboard and two or three bills upon the
table began to ask myself whether had not done very
foolish thing after all if these people had strange fads and
expected obedience on the most extraordinary matters they were
at least ready to pay for their eccentricity very few
governesses in england are getting pounds year besides
what use was my hair to me many people are improved by wearing
it short and perhaps should be among the number next day was
inclined to think that had made mistake and by the day after
was sure of it had almost overcome my pride so far as to go
back to the agency and inquire whether the place was still open
when received this letter from the gentleman himself have it
here and will read it to you

the copper beeches near winchester
dear miss huntermiss stoper has very kindly given me your
address and write from here to ask you whether you have
reconsidered your decision my wife is very anxious that you
should come for she has been much attracted by my description of
you we are willing to give pounds quarter or pounds
year so as to recompense you for any little inconvenience which
our fads may cause you they are not very exacting after all my
wife is fond of particular shade of electric blue and would
like you to wear such dress indoors in the morning you need
not however go to the expense of purchasing one as we have one
belonging to my dear daughter alice now in philadelphia which
would should think fit you very well then as to sitting
here or there or amusing yourself in any manner indicated that
need cause you no inconvenience as regards your hair it is no
doubt pity especially as could not help remarking its beauty
during our short interview but am afraid that must remain
firm upon this point and only hope that the increased salary
may recompense you for the loss your duties as far as the child
is concerned are very light now do try to come and shall
meet you with the dogcart at winchester let me know your train
yours faithfully jephro rucastle

that is the letter which have just received mr holmes and
my mind is made up that will accept it thought however
that before taking the final step should like to submit the
whole matter to your consideration

well miss hunter if your mind is made up that settles the
question said holmes smiling

but you would not advise me to refuse

confess that it is not the situation which should like to
see sister of mine apply for

what is the meaning of it all mr holmes

ah have no data cannot tell perhaps you have yourself
formed some opinion

well there seems to me to be only one possible solution mr
rucastle seemed to be very kind goodnatured man is it not
possible that his wife is lunatic that he desires to keep the
matter quiet for fear she should be taken to an asylum and that
he humours her fancies in every way in order to prevent an
outbreak

that is possible solutionin fact as matters stand it is
the most probable one but in any case it does not seem to be
nice household for young lady

but the money mr holmes the money

well yes of course the pay is goodtoo good that is what
makes me uneasy why should they give you pounds year when
they could have their pick for pounds there must be some
strong reason behind

thought that if told you the circumstances you would
understand afterwards if wanted your help should feel so
much stronger if felt that you were at the back of me

oh you may carry that feeling away with you assure you that
your little problem promises to be the most interesting which has
come my way for some months there is something distinctly novel
about some of the features if you should find yourself in doubt
or in danger

danger what danger do you foresee

holmes shook his head gravely it would cease to be danger if
we could define it said he but at any time day or night
telegram would bring me down to your help

that is enough she rose briskly from her chair with the
anxiety all swept from her face shall go down to hampshire
quite easy in my mind now shall write to mr rucastle at once
sacrifice my poor hair tonight and start for winchester
tomorrow with few grateful words to holmes she bade us both
goodnight and bustled off upon her way

at least said as we heard her quick firm steps descending
the stairs she seems to be young lady who is very well able
to take care of herself

and she would need to be said holmes gravely am much
mistaken if we do not hear from her before many days are past

it was not very long before my friends prediction was fulfilled
fortnight went by during which frequently found my thoughts
turning in her direction and wondering what strange sidealley of
human experience this lonely woman had strayed into the unusual
salary the curious conditions the light duties all pointed to
something abnormal though whether fad or plot or whether
the man were philanthropist or villain it was quite beyond
my powers to determine as to holmes observed that he sat
frequently for half an hour on end with knitted brows and an
abstracted air but he swept the matter away with wave of his
hand when mentioned it data data data he cried
impatiently cant make bricks without clay and yet he would
always wind up by muttering that no sister of his should ever
have accepted such situation

the telegram which we eventually received came late one night
just as was thinking of turning in and holmes was settling down
to one of those allnight chemical researches which he frequently
indulged in when would leave him stooping over retort and
testtube at night and find him in the same position when came
down to breakfast in the morning he opened the yellow envelope
and then glancing at the message threw it across to me

just look up the trains in bradshaw said he and turned back
to his chemical studies

the summons was brief and urgent one

please be at the black swan hotel at winchester at midday
tomorrow it said do come am at my wits end hunter

will you come with me asked holmes glancing up

should wish to

just look it up then

there is train at halfpast nine said glancing over my
bradshaw it is due at winchester at

that will do very nicely then perhaps had better postpone my
analysis of the acetones as we may need to be at our best in the
morning

by eleven oclock the next day we were well upon our way to the
old english capital holmes had been buried in the morning papers
all the way down but after we had passed the hampshire border he
threw them down and began to admire the scenery it was an ideal
spring day light blue sky flecked with little fleecy white
clouds drifting across from west to east the sun was shining
very brightly and yet there was an exhilarating nip in the air
which set an edge to mans energy all over the countryside
away to the rolling hills around aldershot the little red and
grey roofs of the farmsteadings peeped out from amid the light
green of the new foliage

are they not fresh and beautiful cried with all the
enthusiasm of man fresh from the fogs of baker street

but holmes shook his head gravely

do you know watson said he that it is one of the curses of
mind with turn like mine that must look at everything with
reference to my own special subject you look at these scattered
houses and you are impressed by their beauty look at them
and the only thought which comes to me is feeling of their
isolation and of the impunity with which crime may be committed
there

good heavens cried who would associate crime with these
dear old homesteads

they always fill me with certain horror it is my belief
watson founded upon my experience that the lowest and vilest
alleys in london do not present more dreadful record of sin
than does the smiling and beautiful countryside

you horrify me

but the reason is very obvious the pressure of public opinion
can do in the town what the law cannot accomplish there is no
lane so vile that the scream of tortured child or the thud of
drunkards blow does not beget sympathy and indignation among
the neighbours and then the whole machinery of justice is ever
so close that word of complaint can set it going and there is
but step between the crime and the dock but look at these
lonely houses each in its own fields filled for the most part
with poor ignorant folk who know little of the law think of the
deeds of hellish cruelty the hidden wickedness which may go on
year in year out in such places and none the wiser had this
lady who appeals to us for help gone to live in winchester
should never have had fear for her it is the five miles of
country which makes the danger still it is clear that she is
not personally threatened

no if she can come to winchester to meet us she can get away

quite so she has her freedom

what can be the matter then can you suggest no explanation

have devised seven separate explanations each of which would
cover the facts as far as we know them but which of these is
correct can only be determined by the fresh information which we
shall no doubt find waiting for us well there is the tower of
the cathedral and we shall soon learn all that miss hunter has
to tell

the black swan is an inn of repute in the high street at no
distance from the station and there we found the young lady
waiting for us she had engaged sittingroom and our lunch
awaited us upon the table

am so delighted that you have come she said earnestly it
is so very kind of you both but indeed do not know what
should do your advice will be altogether invaluable to me

pray tell us what has happened to you

will do so and must be quick for have promised mr
rucastle to be back before three got his leave to come into
town this morning though he little knew for what purpose

let us have everything in its due order holmes thrust his long
thin legs out towards the fire and composed himself to listen

in the first place may say that have met on the whole
with no actual illtreatment from mr and mrs rucastle it is
only fair to them to say that but cannot understand them and
am not easy in my mind about them

what can you not understand

their reasons for their conduct but you shall have it all just
as it occurred when came down mr rucastle met me here and
drove me in his dogcart to the copper beeches it is as he
said beautifully situated but it is not beautiful in itself
for it is large square block of house whitewashed but all
stained and streaked with damp and bad weather there are grounds
round it woods on three sides and on the fourth field which
slopes down to the southampton highroad which curves past about
hundred yards from the front door this ground in front belongs
to the house but the woods all round are part of lord
southertons preserves clump of copper beeches immediately in
front of the hall door has given its name to the place

was driven over by my employer who was as amiable as ever
and was introduced by him that evening to his wife and the child
there was no truth mr holmes in the conjecture which seemed to
us to be probable in your rooms at baker street mrs rucastle is
not mad found her to be silent palefaced woman much
younger than her husband not more than thirty should think
while he can hardly be less than fortyfive from their
conversation have gathered that they have been married about
seven years that he was widower and that his only child by
the first wife was the daughter who has gone to philadelphia mr
rucastle told me in private that the reason why she had left them
was that she had an unreasoning aversion to her stepmother as
the daughter could not have been less than twenty can quite
imagine that her position must have been uncomfortable with her
fathers young wife

mrs rucastle seemed to me to be colourless in mind as well as
in feature she impressed me neither favourably nor the reverse
she was nonentity it was easy to see that she was passionately
devoted both to her husband and to her little son her light grey
eyes wandered continually from one to the other noting every
little want and forestalling it if possible he was kind to her
also in his bluff boisterous fashion and on the whole they
seemed to be happy couple and yet she had some secret sorrow
this woman she would often be lost in deep thought with the
saddest look upon her face more than once have surprised her
in tears have thought sometimes that it was the disposition of
her child which weighed upon her mind for have never met so
utterly spoiled and so illnatured little creature he is small
for his age with head which is quite disproportionately large
his whole life appears to be spent in an alternation between
savage fits of passion and gloomy intervals of sulking giving
pain to any creature weaker than himself seems to be his one idea
of amusement and he shows quite remarkable talent in planning
the capture of mice little birds and insects but would
rather not talk about the creature mr holmes and indeed he
has little to do with my story

am glad of all details remarked my friend whether they
seem to you to be relevant or not

shall try not to miss anything of importance the one
unpleasant thing about the house which struck me at once was
the appearance and conduct of the servants there are only two
man and his wife toller for that is his name is rough
uncouth man with grizzled hair and whiskers and perpetual
smell of drink twice since have been with them he has been
quite drunk and yet mr rucastle seemed to take no notice of it
his wife is very tall and strong woman with sour face as
silent as mrs rucastle and much less amiable they are most
unpleasant couple but fortunately spend most of my time in the
nursery and my own room which are next to each other in one
corner of the building

for two days after my arrival at the copper beeches my life was
very quiet on the third mrs rucastle came down just after
breakfast and whispered something to her husband

oh yes said he turning to me we are very much obliged to
you miss hunter for falling in with our whims so far as to cut
your hair assure you that it has not detracted in the tiniest
iota from your appearance we shall now see how the electricblue
dress will become you you will find it laid out upon the bed in
your room and if you would be so good as to put it on we should
both be extremely obliged

the dress which found waiting for me was of peculiar shade
of blue it was of excellent material sort of beige but it
bore unmistakable signs of having been worn before it could not
have been better fit if had been measured for it both mr
and mrs rucastle expressed delight at the look of it which
seemed quite exaggerated in its vehemence they were waiting for
me in the drawingroom which is very large room stretching
along the entire front of the house with three long windows
reaching down to the floor chair had been placed close to the
central window with its back turned towards it in this was
asked to sit and then mr rucastle walking up and down on the
other side of the room began to tell me series of the funniest
stories that have ever listened to you cannot imagine how
comical he was and laughed until was quite weary mrs
rucastle however who has evidently no sense of humour never so
much as smiled but sat with her hands in her lap and sad
anxious look upon her face after an hour or so mr rucastle
suddenly remarked that it was time to commence the duties of the
day and that might change my dress and go to little edward in
the nursery

two days later this same performance was gone through under
exactly similar circumstances again changed my dress again
sat in the window and again laughed very heartily at the funny
stories of which my employer had an immense and which
he told inimitably then he handed me yellowbacked novel and
moving my chair little sideways that my own shadow might not
fall upon the page he begged me to read aloud to him read for
about ten minutes beginning in the heart of chapter and then
suddenly in the middle of sentence he ordered me to cease and
to change my dress

you can easily imagine mr holmes how curious became as to
what the meaning of this extraordinary performance could possibly
be they were always very careful observed to turn my face
away from the window so that became consumed with the desire
to see what was going on behind my back at first it seemed to be
impossible but soon devised means my handmirror had been
broken so happy thought seized me and concealed piece of
the glass in my handkerchief on the next occasion in the midst
of my laughter put my handkerchief up to my eyes and was able
with little management to see all that there was behind me
confess that was disappointed there was nothing at least that
was my first impression at the second glance however
perceived that there was man standing in the southampton road
small bearded man in grey suit who seemed to be looking in
my direction the road is an important highway and there are
usually people there this man however was leaning against the
railings which bordered our field and was looking earnestly up
lowered my handkerchief and glanced at mrs rucastle to find her
eyes fixed upon me with most searching gaze she said nothing
but am convinced that she had divined that had mirror in my
hand and had seen what was behind me she rose at once

jephro said she there is an impertinent fellow upon the
road there who stares up at miss hunter

no friend of yours miss hunter he asked

no know no one in these parts

dear me how very impertinent kindly turn round and motion to
him to go away

surely it would be better to take no notice

no no we should have him loitering here always kindly turn
round and wave him away like that

did as was told and at the same instant mrs rucastle drew
down the blind that was week ago and from that time have
not sat again in the window nor have worn the blue dress nor
seen the man in the road

pray continue said holmes your narrative promises to be
most interesting one

you will find it rather disconnected fear and there may
prove to be little relation between the different incidents of
which speak on the very first day that was at the copper
beeches mr rucastle took me to small outhouse which stands
near the kitchen door as we approached it heard the sharp
rattling of chain and the sound as of large animal moving
about

look in here said mr rucastle showing me slit between two
planks is he not beauty

looked through and was conscious of two glowing eyes and of
vague figure huddled up in the darkness

dont be frightened said my employer laughing at the start
which had given its only carlo my mastiff call him mine
but really old toller my groom is the only man who can do
anything with him we feed him once day and not too much then
so that he is always as keen as mustard toller lets him loose
every night and god help the trespasser whom he lays his fangs
upon for goodness sake dont you ever on any pretext set your
foot over the threshold at night for its as much as your life
is worth

the warning was no idle one for two nights later happened to
look out of my bedroom window about two oclock in the morning
it was beautiful moonlight night and the lawn in front of the
house was silvered over and almost as bright as day was
standing rapt in the peaceful beauty of the scene when was
aware that something was moving under the shadow of the copper
beeches as it emerged into the moonshine saw what it was it
was giant dog as large as calf tawny tinted with hanging
jowl black muzzle and huge projecting bones it walked slowly
across the lawn and vanished into the shadow upon the other side
that dreadful sentinel sent chill to my heart which do not
think that any burglar could have done

and now have very strange experience to tell you had as
you know cut off my hair in london and had placed it in
great coil at the bottom of my trunk one evening after the
child was in bed began to amuse myself by examining the
furniture of my room and by rearranging my own little things
there was an old chest of drawers in the room the two upper ones
empty and open the lower one locked had filled the first two
with my linen and as had still much to pack away was
naturally annoyed at not having the use of the third drawer it
struck me that it might have been fastened by mere oversight
so took out my bunch of keys and tried to open it the very
first key fitted to perfection and drew the drawer open there
was only one thing in it but am sure that you would never
guess what it was it was my coil of hair

took it up and examined it it was of the same peculiar tint
and the same thickness but then the impossibility of the thing
obtruded itself upon me how could my hair have been locked in
the drawer with trembling hands undid my trunk turned out the
contents and drew from the bottom my own hair laid the two
tresses together and assure you that they were identical was
it not extraordinary puzzle as would could make nothing at
all of what it meant returned the strange hair to the drawer
and said nothing of the matter to the rucastles as felt that
had put myself in the wrong by opening drawer which they had
locked

am naturally observant as you may have remarked mr holmes
and soon had pretty good plan of the whole house in my head
there was one wing however which appeared not to be inhabited
at all door which faced that which led into the quarters of
the tollers opened into this suite but it was invariably locked
one day however as ascended the stair met mr rucastle
coming out through this door his keys in his hand and look on
his face which made him very different person to the round
jovial man to whom was accustomed his cheeks were red his
brow was all crinkled with anger and the veins stood out at his
temples with passion he locked the door and hurried past me
without word or look

this aroused my curiosity so when went out for walk in the
grounds with my charge strolled round to the side from which
could see the windows of this part of the house there were four
of them in row three of which were simply dirty while the
fourth was shuttered up they were evidently all deserted as
strolled up and down glancing at them occasionally mr rucastle
came out to me looking as merry and jovial as ever

ah said he you must not think me rude if passed you
without word my dear young lady was preoccupied with
business matters

assured him that was not offended by the way said
you seem to have quite suite of spare rooms up there and one
of them has the shutters up

he looked surprised and as it seemed to me little startled
at my remark

photography is one of my hobbies said he have made my
dark room up there but dear me what an observant young lady we
have come upon who would have believed it who would have ever
believed it he spoke in jesting tone but there was no jest
in his eyes as he looked at me read suspicion there and
annoyance but no jest

well mr holmes from the moment that understood that there
was something about that suite of rooms which was not to know
was all on fire to go over them it was not mere curiosity
though have my share of that it was more feeling of dutya
feeling that some good might come from my penetrating to this
place they talk of womans instinct perhaps it was womans
instinct which gave me that feeling at any rate it was there
and was keenly on the lookout for any chance to pass the
forbidden door

it was only yesterday that the chance came may tell you that
besides mr rucastle both toller and his wife find something to
do in these deserted rooms and once saw him carrying large
black linen bag with him through the door recently he has been
drinking hard and yesterday evening he was very drunk and when
came upstairs there was the key in the door have no doubt at
all that he had left it there mr and mrs rucastle were both
downstairs and the child was with them so that had an
admirable opportunity turned the key gently in the lock
opened the door and slipped through

there was little passage in front of me unpapered and
uncarpeted which turned at right angle at the farther end
round this corner were three doors in line the first and third
of which were open they each led into an empty room dusty and
cheerless with two windows in the one and one in the other so
thick with dirt that the evening light glimmered dimly through
them the centre door was closed and across the outside of it
had been fastened one of the broad bars of an iron bed padlocked
at one end to ring in the wall and fastened at the other with
stout cord the door itself was locked as well and the key was
not there this barricaded door corresponded clearly with the
shuttered window outside and yet could see by the glimmer from
beneath it that the room was not in darkness evidently there was
skylight which let in light from above as stood in the
passage gazing at the sinister door and wondering what secret it
might veil suddenly heard the sound of steps within the room
and saw shadow pass backward and forward against the little
slit of dim light which shone out from under the door mad
unreasoning terror rose up in me at the sight mr holmes my
overstrung nerves failed me suddenly and turned and ranran
as though some dreadful hand were behind me clutching at the
skirt of my dress rushed down the passage through the door
and straight into the arms of mr rucastle who was waiting
outside

so said he smiling it was you then thought that it
must be when saw the door open

oh am so frightened panted

my dear young lady my dear young ladyyou cannot think how
caressing and soothing his manner wasand what has frightened
you my dear young lady

but his voice was just little too coaxing he overdid it
was keenly on my guard against him

was foolish enough to go into the empty wing answered
but it is so lonely and eerie in this dim light that was
frightened and ran out again oh it is so dreadfully still in
there

only that said he looking at me keenly

why what did you think asked

why do you think that lock this door

am sure that do not know

it is to keep people out who have no business there do you
see he was still smiling in the most amiable manner

am sure if had known

well then you know now and if you ever put your foot over
that threshold againhere in an instant the smile hardened into
grin of rage and he glared down at me with the face of
demonill throw you to the mastiff

was so terrified that do not know what did suppose that
must have rushed past him into my room remember nothing
until found myself lying on my bed trembling all over then
thought of you mr holmes could not live there longer without
some advice was frightened of the house of the man of the
woman of the servants even of the child they were all horrible
to me if could only bring you down all would be well of
course might have fled from the house but my curiosity was
almost as strong as my fears my mind was soon made up would
send you wire put on my hat and cloak went down to the
office which is about half mile from the house and then
returned feeling very much easier horrible doubt came into my
mind as approached the door lest the dog might be loose but
remembered that toller had drunk himself into state of
insensibility that evening and knew that he was the only one
in the household who had any influence with the savage creature
or who would venture to set him free slipped in in safety and
lay awake half the night in my joy at the thought of seeing you
had no difficulty in getting leave to come into winchester this
morning but must be back before three oclock for mr and
mrs rucastle are going on visit and will be away all the
evening so that must look after the child now have told you
all my adventures mr holmes and should be very glad if you
could tell me what it all means and above all what should
do

holmes and had listened spellbound to this extraordinary story
my friend rose now and paced up and down the room his hands in
his pockets and an expression of the most profound gravity upon
his face

is toller still drunk he asked

yes heard his wife tell mrs rucastle that she could do
nothing with him

that is well and the rucastles go out tonight

yes

is there cellar with good strong lock

yes the winecellar

you seem to me to have acted all through this matter like very
brave and sensible girl miss hunter do you think that you could
perform one more feat should not ask it of you if did not
think you quite exceptional woman

will try what is it

we shall be at the copper beeches by seven oclock my friend
and the rucastles will be gone by that time and toller will
we hope be incapable there only remains mrs toller who might
give the alarm if you could send her into the cellar on some
errand and then turn the key upon her you would facilitate
matters immensely

will do it

excellent we shall then look thoroughly into the affair of
course there is only one feasible explanation you have been
brought there to personate someone and the real person is
imprisoned in this chamber that is obvious as to who this
prisoner is have no doubt that it is the daughter miss alice
rucastle if remember right who was said to have gone to
america you were chosen doubtless as resembling her in height
figure and the colour of your hair hers had been cut off very
possibly in some illness through which she has passed and so of
course yours had to be sacrificed also by curious chance you
came upon her tresses the man in the road was undoubtedly some
friend of herspossibly her no doubt as you wore
the girls dress and were so like her he was convinced from your
laughter whenever he saw you and afterwards from your gesture
that miss rucastle was perfectly happy and that she no longer
desired his attentions the dog is let loose at night to prevent
him from endeavouring to communicate with her so much is fairly
clear the most serious point in the case is the disposition of
the child

what on earth has that to do with it ejaculated

my dear watson you as medical man are continually gaining
light as to the tendencies of child by the study of the
parents dont you see that the converse is equally valid have
frequently gained my first real insight into the character of
parents by studying their children this childs disposition is
abnormally cruel merely for crueltys sake and whether he
derives this from his smiling father as should suspect or
from his mother it bodes evil for the poor girl who is in their
power

am sure that you are right mr holmes cried our client
thousand things come back to me which make me certain that you
have hit it oh let us lose not an instant in bringing help to
this poor creature

we must be circumspect for we are dealing with very cunning
man we can do nothing until seven oclock at that hour we shall
be with you and it will not be long before we solve the
mystery

we were as good as our word for it was just seven when we
reached the copper beeches having put up our trap at wayside
publichouse the group of trees with their dark leaves shining
like burnished metal in the light of the setting sun were
sufficient to mark the house even had miss hunter not been
standing smiling on the doorstep

have you managed it asked holmes

loud thudding noise came from somewhere downstairs that is
mrs toller in the cellar said she her husband lies snoring
on the kitchen rug here are his keys which are the duplicates
of mr rucastles

you have done well indeed cried holmes with enthusiasm now
lead the way and we shall soon see the end of this black
business

we passed up the stair unlocked the door followed on down
passage and found ourselves in front of the barricade which miss
hunter had described holmes cut the cord and removed the
transverse bar then he tried the various keys in the lock but
without success no sound came from within and at the silence
holmes face clouded over

trust that we are not too late said he think miss
hunter that we had better go in without you now watson put
your shoulder to it and we shall see whether we cannot make our
way in

it was an old rickety door and gave at once before our united
strength together we rushed into the room it was empty there
was no furniture save little pallet bed small table and
basketful of linen the skylight above was open and the prisoner
gone

there has been some villainy here said holmes this beauty
has guessed miss hunters intentions and has carried his victim
off

but how

through the skylight we shall soon see how he managed it he
swung himself up onto the roof ah yes he cried heres the
end of long light ladder against the eaves that is how he did
it

but it is impossible said miss hunter the ladder was not
there when the rucastles went away

he has come back and done it tell you that he is clever and
dangerous man should not be very much surprised if this were
he whose step hear now upon the stair think watson that it
would be as well for you to have your pistol ready

the words were hardly out of his mouth before man appeared at
the door of the room very fat and burly man with heavy
stick in his hand miss hunter screamed and shrunk against the
wall at the sight of him but sherlock holmes sprang forward and
confronted him

you villain said he wheres your daughter

the fat man cast his eyes round and then up at the open
skylight

it is for me to ask you that he shrieked you thieves spies
and thieves have caught you have you are in my power ill
serve you he turned and clattered down the stairs as hard as he
could go

hes gone for the dog cried miss hunter

have my revolver said

better close the front door cried holmes and we all rushed
down the stairs together we had hardly reached the hall when we
heard the baying of hound and then scream of agony with
horrible worrying sound which it was dreadful to listen to an
elderly man with red face and shaking limbs came staggering out
at side door

my god he cried someone has loosed the dog its not been
fed for two days quick quick or itll be too late

holmes and rushed out and round the angle of the house with
toller hurrying behind us there was the huge famished brute its
black muzzle buried in rucastles throat while he writhed and
screamed upon the ground running up blew its brains out and
it fell over with its keen white teeth still meeting in the great
creases of his neck with much labour we separated them and
carried him living but horribly mangled into the house we laid
him upon the drawingroom sofa and having dispatched the sobered
toller to bear the news to his wife did what could to
relieve his pain we were all assembled round him when the door
opened and tall gaunt woman entered the room

mrs toller cried miss hunter

yes miss mr rucastle let me out when he came back before he
went up to you ah miss it is pity you didnt let me know
what you were planning for would have told you that your pains
were wasted

ha said holmes looking keenly at her it is clear that mrs
toller knows more about this matter than anyone else

yes sir do and am ready enough to tell what know

then pray sit down and let us hear it for there are several
points on which must confess that am still in the dark

will soon make it clear to you said she and id have done
so before now if could ha got out from the cellar if theres
policecourt business over this youll remember that was the
one that stood your friend and that was miss alices friend
too

she was never happy at home miss alice wasnt from the time
that her father married again she was slighted like and had no
say in anything but it never really became bad for her until
after she met mr fowler at friends house as well as could
learn miss alice had rights of her own by will but she was so
quiet and patient she was that she never said word about them
but just left everything in mr rucastles hands he knew he was
safe with her but when there was chance of husband coming
forward who would ask for all that the law would give him then
her father thought it time to put stop on it he wanted her to
sign paper so that whether she married or not he could use
her money when she wouldnt do it he kept on worrying her until
she got brainfever and for six weeks was at deaths door then
she got better at last all worn to shadow and with her
beautiful hair cut off but that didnt make no change in her
young man and he stuck to her as true as man could be

ah said holmes think that what you have been good enough
to tell us makes the matter fairly clear and that can deduce
all that remains mr rucastle then presume took to this
system of imprisonment

yes sir

and brought miss hunter down from london in order to get rid of
the disagreeable persistence of mr fowler

that was it sir

but mr fowler being persevering man as good seaman should
be blockaded the house and having met you succeeded by certain
arguments metallic or otherwise in convincing you that your
interests were the same as his

mr fowler was very kindspoken freehanded gentleman said
mrs toller serenely

and in this way he managed that your good man should have no
want of drink and that ladder should be ready at the moment
when your master had gone out

you have it sir just as it happened

am sure we owe you an apology mrs toller said holmes for
you have certainly cleared up everything which puzzled us and
here comes the country surgeon and mrs rucastle so think
watson that we had best escort miss hunter back to winchester
as it seems to me that our locus standi now is rather
questionable one

and thus was solved the mystery of the sinister house with the
copper beeches in front of the door mr rucastle survived but
was always broken man kept alive solely through the care of
his devoted wife they still live with their old servants who
probably know so much of rucastles past life that he finds it
difficult to part from them mr fowler and miss rucastle were
married by special license in southampton the day after their
flight and he is now the holder of government appointment in
the island of mauritius as to miss violet hunter my friend
holmes rather to my disappointment manifested no further
interest in her when once she had ceased to be the centre of one
of his problems and she is now the head of private school at
walsall where believe that she has met with considerable success
