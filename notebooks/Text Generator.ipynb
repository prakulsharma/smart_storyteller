I went and sat in my chair, and took the opportunity of catching her the minute she came in \n","She was not quite at a loss for a moment, but immediately went to me to ask my advice \n","The first answer I could do, was that I was at liberty to decide to either continue in the house, or to leave \n","She thought that Mrs    would not want me any more, and I could not have better advice;

so that I was quite satisfied with being so employed, that I was at a loss to discover what would be the consequence of my refusing \n","I was therefore very much surprised, and in many respects surprised, to see Dragoe and Jane in my presence \n","It occurred to me to inquire,\n","If she could not leave the house,\n","No, nothing could keep her from it \n","Then, without answering, without indicating how I was to know it, I told her of her choice?\n","What is it, asked she, Mr    I am quite sure that she will not refuse me\n","I replied positively, that I was sure; but I was not to tell her that she had not only the right to choose whether she would or no, but that her father and mother might not only be with her, but in my presence \n","I went on thus to amuse myself, when Mr    went to his study  I had just completed my work in preparing it on the previous night, when Dragoe, a little before evening-time, came up to me to request my leave of absence \n","Mr    had not yet entered the study, when I called upon him\n","\n","Saving checkpoint/run1/model-1500\n","======== SAMPLE 1 ========\n","als had begun to change;
