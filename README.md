# Smart Storyteller

## About
This project aims to create a deep learning model for the purpose of automatically generating captions for images and thereafter performing storytelling with the help of that caption.
It encompasses the creative method of storytelling by studying an image by detecting and understanding its contents using deep learning and generating human-like stories thus proving it to be a viable approach for various applications.

## Motivation
Being able to automatically describe the contents of an image after image processing, using properly formed English sentences is rather a very challenging task. Although, it proves to have various viable and effective applications in our day-to-day lives. For instance, it can be used to generate reports using certain visual cues in various medical diagnoses, visually impaired people can be made to understand what the image is about. Creating news from an image is another application using this principle. Creating stories, poems or plays in the style of someone whoâ€™s either no longer alive or wishes to create his/her works faster. It can even be used for the purpose of script writing.

## Languages, Tools and Libraries
Google Colab, Python, Tensorflow, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Numpy, Inception v3, GPT-2
